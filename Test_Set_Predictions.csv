New Delhi: Gadgets have become an integral part of our lives with most of us relying on some form of factor to communicate, commute, work, be informed or entertained. Year 2019 will see some gadgets lifting the user experience to a whole new level. Heres what we can expect to see:


Smartphones with foldable screens: Foldable phones are finally moving from the concept stage to commercial launches. They are made up of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panels with higher plastic substrates, allowing them to be bent without damage.


US-based display maker Royole Corps foldable phone, FlexPai, has already arrived in select markets, while Samsungs unnamed foldable phone is expected sometime next year. Samsungs smartphone chief executive officer D.J. Koh has said they will make a million units of it. LG, too, is expected to display a foldable phone next year. Meanwhile Apple, Nokia, Lenovo and Huawei have also been working on foldable phones, reportedly.


eSIM: Very soon your smartphone wont need a physical SIM card anymore. The eSIM technology, already used by Apple in its iPhones and Apple Watch, replaces the physical SIM with a virtually embedded chip on the motherboard. eSIMs support multiple mobile operators and can be programmed to switch services.",2019 see gadget like gaming smartphones wearable medical device lifting user experience whole new level mintindiawire consumer technologyconsumer technology trend new yeartech gadgetsfoldable phonesgaming smartphoneswearable medical devicestechnology new delhi gadget become integral part life u relying form factor communicate commute work informed entertained year 2019 see gadget lifting user experience whole new level heres expect see smartphones foldable screen foldable phone finally moving concept stage commercial launch made organic lightemitting diode oled panel higher plastic substrate allowing bent without damage usbased display maker royole corps foldable phone flexpai already arrived select market samsungs unnamed foldable phone expected sometime next year samsungs smartphone chief executive officer dj koh said make million unit lg expected display foldable phone next year meanwhile apple nokia lenovo huawei also working foldable phone reportedly esim soon smartphone wont need physical sim card anymore esim technology already used apple iphones apple watch replaces physical sim virtually embedded chip motherboard esims support multiple mobile operator programmed switch service,1

"The NCP leadership was under tremendous pressure to consider fielding third-generation Pawars from key constituencies in western Maharashtra. Parth Pawar was open about his keenness to contest from the Maval Lok Sabha constituency near Pune. Rohit Pawar, son of Sharad Pawars brother Rajendra Pawar, is also keen on entering the electoral arena and has set his eyes on the Karjat-Jamkhed assembly constituency in Ahmednagar constituency. The pressure increased after Sharad Pawar said he would contest from Madha while Sule would seek re-election from Baramati.


Last month, Sharad Pawar sought to end speculation by saying that no third-generation Pawar would contest Lok Sabha polls. However, NCP leaders and some legislators say that both Parth Pawar and Rohit Pawar were not ready to wait.

In West Bengal, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is looking to win at least half the seats, says the partys state president and Medinipur candidate Dilip Ghosh. Tackling corruption and implementing National Register of Citizens are on the partys agenda if it wins, he said in an interview.


Restoration of democracy is the main agenda of this election. The one-point programme of the BJP is to protect democracy because there is no democracy in West Bengal. In the panchayat elections last year, people could not file nominations for over a third of the seats. Trinamool Congress members surrounded the office where nominations were to be filed for seven days. There was large-scale violence during panchayat elections. In 20,100 of 58,000 panchayat seats, nobody could file a nomination; over 42% of rural voters were unable to cast their votes. This is the situation in West Bengal. The second big issue is corruption and political violence. At least 42 BJP workers were killed and over 100 political killings have happened across the state. The police force is not allowed to investigate these cases. Yet, BJP won 7,000 seats in the panchayat election even after so much violence.

If it werent for the large, ugly hoardings in the citys main enclaves, it would be difficult to guess theres an election in a few days in this city of eight million. Not that Ahmedabad is politically irrelevant. Home to Gandhis famous Sabarmati Ashram, it was also the city where the Navnirman Movement began in 1974-75, when a protest by young college students over the issue of mess bills, snowballed into a state-wide protest against spiraling prices and government corruption, leading to the resignation of then chief minister Chimanbhai Patel. That event kickstarted the nationwide movement against Indira Gandhis government, leading to the declaration of Emergency soon after.

"The new economy has created its own hubs, and Gujarat, though known for its hard-working and business-minded ways, seems to have stayed within traditional set-ups. The recent startup boom has also seen firms focused on disruptive technology choose the twin cities in the south and Gurugram in the north and Pune in the west rather than Ahmedabad.


The closure of traditional businesses and mills, the primary employers of the past century, also coincided with a deeper change in the fabric of Ahmedabad.


The economic changes caused fissures between Hindu and Muslim communities, which eventually led to riots in 1985, 1992 and again in 2002. The city that prides itself on its link to Gandhi is also one where his ideals tend to be forgotten.


It is interesting that the city first witnessed riots between Hindus and Muslims in the 1980s, around the same time many lost formal employment and livelihood because of the closure of the textile mills,"" says Rutul Joshi, associate professor at the city-based CEPT University (formerly called the Centre for Environmental Planning and Technology).",new economy created hub gujarat though known hardworking businessminded way seems stayed within traditional setup recent startup boom also seen firm focused disruptive technology choose twin city south gurugram north pune west rather ahmedabad closure traditional business mill primary employer past century also coincided deeper change fabric ahmedabad economic change caused fissure hindu muslim community eventually led riot 1985 1992 2002 city pride link gandhi also one ideal tend forgotten it interesting city first witnessed riot hindu muslim 1980s around time many lost formal employment livelihood closure textile mill say rutul joshi associate professor citybased cept university formerly called centre environmental planning technology,0

"Today, we think of Marvel as the monolithic studio that each year reliably releases two or three blockbusters based on its costume-clad comic-book superheroes


 It has built movies like Captain Marvel and Black Panther into money-minting franchises, and when its latest offering, Avengers: Endgame, is released April 26, it will conclude a narrative spanning some 22 films that started with Iron Man in 2008


 In the mid-2000s it was a smaller, inexperienced company that controlled the film rights for only a few of its lesser-known characters  other studios had already brought X-Men, Spider-Man and Fantastic Four to theaters  at a time when no one in Hollywood was yet contemplating the idea of an interconnected universe of superhero movies


That changed with the help of people like Kevin Feige, who had been an associate producer on X-Men before Marvel hired him in 2000; and Robert Downey Jr


, the veteran actor who was almost no ones idea of a mass-market magnet when he emerged as a candidate to play Tony Stark, the eccentric billionaire hero of Iron Man


In interviews, Feige, now president of Marvel Studios, and Downey  a star of three Iron Mans, four Avengers and a Spider-Man  spoke about the origins of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the choices they made, and what its all meant as Endgame approaches


KEVIN FEIGE: In 2006, when we were making our first appearance as our own studio at Comic-Con, the articles written around that were basically: Marvels going to try to make movies themselves now


 Iron Man became one of them when the rights reverted back to Marvel from [New Line Cinema]; it instantly went to the top of the list


 And internally, at Marvel corporate, Hulk  by far, the better-known property  seemed like the slam dunk and Iron Man seemed like the risk


Marvel started hiring cast and crew for Iron Man in 2006  first, director Jon Favreau and then its star, Robert Downey Jr

"India continues to be in the top-five market for us in the world, which I think is pretty interesting, especially considering the cautious positioning that the regulators and the authorities are taking in the country. But for people that already have it (crypto currencies), having tools to trade and exchange and securely store crypto is still super valuable. Im still pretty optimistic that in the long run India will be one of the places where digital currencies could have a very powerful and significant impact in helping people with access to smartphones to be able to move money around as easily as sending a message. That being said, there are reasonable and understandable concerns and risks that should be addressed. In other markets, were seeing very strong pro-innovation regulatory environments that are allowing for very fast iteration on these capabilities. Weve received strong regulatory guidance and clarity across Europe and the US. South Korea and Japan are also very forward on this stuff.

I think credit cards are really a terrible mechanism for banking, especially over the internet.


In terms of throughput, its not a lot of work to do to increase capacity on these (blockchain) transaction networks. Just two weeks ago, we (blockchain.com) announced the introduction of Stellar, which allows for a much higher volume of transactional volume on a per second basis than bitcoin does, for example.

According to the Foundations report, many groups are created by people with Indian phone numbers with their group descriptions in Hindi. Many of these groups also lay emphasis on sharing of child pornography videos and no other links, while some require their members to share a specified number of videos every day or face dismissal from the group.

"With the slowdown of smartphone sales worldwide, phone companies are also looking forward to new concepts to get buyers to switch to new phones. Foldable display and phones with multiple cameras are going to be the key factors. Samsung will be launching foldable phones this year and reports suggest that Huawei, LG and Lenovo have also got their flexible phones and concepts lined-up for the event. HMD Globals Nokia 9 PureView is expected to be the first smartphone with five rear cameras. Images of a Nokia smartphone with five cameras on the back were leaked online early this week.


The year 2019 will see proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT)-driven smart speakers. Samsung is expected to expand its Galaxy Home speakers portfolio with more affordable variants on the lines of Amazons Echo Dot, breaking the Google and Amazon monopoly in this segment. The company will, thus, provide buyers with an alternative ecosystem of IoT devices running Samsungs Bixby assistant. CES 2019 will also see a splurge in headphones with built-in assistants.


Autonomous cars with advanced infotainment systems will be the talking point this year. Audi is expected to unveil a new car infotainment system for autonomous cars. The infotainment system will work even when the car is stationary and getting charged. BMW is reportedly going to introduce an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered virtual assistant of its own on the lines of Amazons Alexa.

"Further rupee gains maybe limited in the near term due to USD/INR support at 200-DMA, currently at 70.58, and an additional support at 69.230, the Jan. 7 low  (Reuters)


Indias rupee has snapped out of its recent doldrums, thanks to the easing in the military skirmishes with Pakistan and strong foreign flows into the nations shares. Analysts arent sure if the gains will sustain with elections due by May.


The currency has rebounded about 2% since early February, and is no longer the worst performer this year among Asias emerging market currencies -- a tag it held as recent as last week when tensions between India and Pakistan briefly reached the highest point since a 1971 war.


The flare up settled just as global funds warmed up to local shares again. They invested a net $2.4 billion last month, the most since November 2017.

"The BJP should benefit from a wave of anti-incumbency against the Trinamool Congress, but fear is a key factor in this election. (Sayantan Bera/Mint)


Widespread anger over violence during panchayat polls has turned 2019 Lok Sabha elections into a referendum on TMC's rule


The BJPs strategy of whipping up Hindu religious pride in West Bengal, where 27% people are Muslims, seems to be paying off


Purulia/Bongaon/Kolkata: ""I am not a magician, I have done so much for youeven if I sell my blood, it will not get enough money (for your needs),"" a visibly emotional Mamata Banerjee told the crowd at an election rally in West Bengal on Tuesday. At every public meeting84 have been planned so far, two for each parliamentary constituency in the statethe chief minister has been presenting a report card of her eight years at the helm in Bengal, and ending her speeches with an earthy appeal on the importance of maintaining communal harmony. Didi, as she is fondly referred to, typically ends her speech by reciting parts of Chandi shloka, an ode to goddess DurgaBengals most worshipped deity.


After a visit to the Bengal hinterland, it becomes clear why the chief of Trinamool Congress (TMC) needs to invoke the gods. Mamata is fighting a furious battle to protect her turf from a resurgent Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).


The unpaved road which connects Bisriya village to the outside world is as rugged as it gets. On a hot summer afternoon in April, the village in West Bengals Purulia district, bordering Jharkhand, wore a deserted look. Few were lazing under the shade of a giant Kusum tree.


Shyamapada Mahato, 62, once a devoted worker of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPM, was the first to speak. In a calm voice, Mahato, who farms on less than a third of an acre of land, lists his grudges against the Mamata-led government. Most schemes, be it old-age pension for farmers or the state governments housing scheme for the poor, have eluded him. At every step you need to bribe local party leaders... in the 100-days work programme (the centres employment guarantee scheme) the work is being done by JCB machines. For every ?1,000 transferred to bank accounts as wages for work we never did, we are asked to keep ?100 and give the rest to them.

"Oh yes, and with good frame rates. While the default setting is medium, you can yank it up to High with the help of GFX tool and it works just fine at that. Frame rates were consistently over 45FPS and there was no choppy gameplay whatsoever.


I gave the Realme 2 Pro a lot of flak for its UI (ColorOS 5.2), but Realme (read Oppo) has rolled out some upgrades to get rid of the previous annoyances like app notifications and bloatware. The phone runs Android Oreo out of the box and there are no promises from Realme about a Pie upgrade, but since Oppo was a Android 9 developer partner, we can expect it to come by the January.


Coming back to the UI, there is still no app drawer, but the UI now allows you to swipe and dismiss notifications. The bloatware can also be uninstalled, bar a few apps like ORoaming.


Some apps do come in the way of the notch, but you can disable the notch on an app-by-app basis. The music app also likes to autoplay a Rakshabandhan"" compilation whenever you pair a Bluetooth audio device, which can be mildly unnerving.


You can fix the lack of an app drawer with a launcher like Nova, but there isnt really much of a fix for the drop-down notification bar.


The camera of Realme U1 is a mixed bag. It is a selfie-focused smartphone, so lets dig into that first, even though Im not much of a selfie person.


The front camera consists of a 25MP Sony IMX576 sensor paired with Helio P70s image processing platform.


The AI capabilities allow 296 facial identification points (an overkill, but doesnt hurt) and better noise and colour recovery.

"The only thing we loathe about the phone is its app optimisation, which might get better as it receives the Pie upgrade.


This smartphone has Play"" in its name, which definitely means it means business, right? Yes. It has the best chipset Huawei has to offer, the HiSilicon 970, which walks abreast with Snapdragon 845 standards. Although it doesnt have any tricks to keep it cool, it can run PUBG on its best settings without any frame drops or heating tantrums. It also has a fairly premium design and very decent AI-powered cameras.


The only thing we dislike about this phone is its UI, which lacks an app drawer and has childish icons.


This phone is an absolute steal for the kind of display, software and, most importantly, the camera it has to offer all at just a rupee below ? 20,000. The rear of the phone sports a 12MP+5MP ZEISS-enhanced package. At the front, it comes with an 8MP camera with f/2.0 aperture. The phone was launched yesterday and it will go on sale on 7 December, so you might have to wait a bit if you wanted to buy this phone right away.


Other things to like about the smartphone are the 5.84-inch HDR display, ability to notch it up to Android Pie, understated design and stock Android experience, thanks to the Android One platform it runs (if youre into that).


The Mi A2 received quite a bit of flak for skipping crucial features like the Micro USB port and a 3.5mm headphone jack. It also received a significant bump in its price. But that doesnt make the Mi A2 a slacker by any means. It is powered by the best mid-range processor Qualcomm had to offer at the time, the Snapdragon 660 and runs stock Android. It also has one of the best cameras in the segment12MP + 20MP dual rear camera module and 20MP front-facing camera, both of which are AI-enabled.

"This years TV is called the LG Signature TV OLED R and its screen disappears into the base when not in use. While that is impressive technology indeed, we knew it was coming for years now.


Like LGs rollable OLED, Samsungs new micro-LED TV doesnt really tickle our fancy either. Thats because the original version of this was announced at CES 2018. Known as The Wall"", the micro-LED TV was too big for any household at the time. So, Samsung has now made it smaller, enough to fill an average household. The new micro-LED TV comes in 75-inch screen size, which is more suited to mainstream use. What this really means is that micro-LED technology (which has been around for a few years) is finally ready for mainstream use, though its nowhere close to being affordable just yet.


Micro-LED is a technology similar to Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED), though unlike OLEDs, it doesnt use organic compounds to create light. Micro-LED offers the same picture quality as OLEDs, but is said to be brighter and overcomes OLEDs one big weakness burn in (a displays tendency to retain images, thereby forming discolouration in certain areas and affecting the overall viewing experience).",years tv called lg signature tv oled r screen disappears base use impressive technology indeed knew coming year like lgs rollable oled samsungs new microled tv doesnt really tickle fancy either thats original version announced ce 2018 known the wall microled tv big household time samsung made smaller enough fill average household new microled tv come 75inch screen size suited mainstream use really mean microled technology around year finally ready mainstream use though its nowhere close affordable yet microled technology similar organic light emitting diode oled though unlike oled doesnt use organic compound create light microled offer picture quality oled said brighter overcomes oleds one big weakness burn displays tendency retain image thereby forming discolouration certain area affecting overall viewing experience,1

If that wasnt enough, Huawei went on to announce two other phonesMate 20 X and Mate 20RS Porsche Design.


The Mate 20 X is essentially the Mate 20 on steroids, aimed at gamers. The differences include a larger 7.1-inch display, vapour chamber with graphene film cooling (similar to the Poco F1) and a 5,000mAh battery. Since the screen is so big, Huawei found the perfect reason to launch the Huawei M Pen (sold separately) stylus. The Mate 20 X is priced at 899 euros (about ? 76,500).


The Porsche Design variant is essentially the Mate 20 Pro on steroids, aimed at the rich and ostentatious.

"Cybersecurity has become a critical business continuity issue. There truly are only two types of companies: those that know they have been hacked, and those that do not. The operational, financial and reputational costs of breaches are rising as well. In some cases, CEOs and board members have been forced to resign. Many boards, however, are just waking up to this risk. The following questions can provide a framework for corporate directors as they fulfil their fiduciary responsibilities.


It is critical to risk-rank data assets to identify which ones can make or break an organization. For instance, the clinical trials data of a pharmaceutical company, call data records of a telecom enterprise and patient care records of a hospital would fall in the high-risk category. How can such crown jewels be protected? The mainstream approach is to identify potential threat-actors and vulnerabilities, implement controls, and finally, thwart attacks by leveraging analytics-enabled threat-monitoring tools. Another approachsuggested by leading cybersecurity expertsis to isolate critical assets from the internet, minimize their digital footprint, and monitor them by using analogue devices and trusted human beings.


Influenced by technology companies effective marketing, business leaders spend an inordinate amount of time worrying about new-age threats and investing ever more in new security products that can help them stay ahead of tech-savvy hackers.",cybersecurity become critical business continuity issue truly two type company know hacked operational financial reputational cost breach rising well case ceo board member forced resign many board however waking risk following question provide framework corporate director fulfil fiduciary responsibility critical riskrank data asset identify one make break organization instance clinical trial data pharmaceutical company call data record telecom enterprise patient care record hospital would fall highrisk category crown jewel protected mainstream approach identify potential threatactors vulnerability implement control finally thwart attack leveraging analyticsenabled threatmonitoring tool another approachsuggested leading cybersecurity expertsis isolate critical asset internet minimize digital footprint monitor using analogue device trusted human being influenced technology companies effective marketing business leader spend inordinate amount time worrying newage threat investing ever new security product help stay ahead techsavvy hacker,1

Of course, Windows 10 still needs work when it comes to touch friendliness, unlike Android or iOS, which are designed for touch inputs.

In reality, it hosts diverse content including a fair share of political speech,"" said Kailas Karthikeyan, a New Delhi-based technology analyst who has tracked TikTok for nine months.


TikTok's video-only interface makes it less elaborate and easier to use compared to platforms such as Facebook or Twitter, making it a bigger attraction in rural India, he added.

Total views for political videos is far higher.


Amit Malviya, the BJP's chief of information technology, said the party was tracking TikTok conversations and it was ""a brilliant medium for creative expression"". The party, however, has no plans as of now to officially join the platform, he said.


A Congress source said the party was exploring joining TikTok and assessing how it could be used to better reach out to people in rural areas in the run-up to the election.

It is unclear how much revenue the pirate distributors are siphoning away from Apple and legitimate app makers  


SAN FRANCISCO: Software pirates have hijacked technology designed by Apple Inc to distribute hacked versions of Spotify, Angry Birds, Pokemon Go, Minecraft and other popular apps on iPhones, Reuters has found.


Illicit software distributors such as TutuApp, Panda Helper, AppValley and TweakBox have found ways to use digital certificates to get access to a program Apple introduced to let corporations distribute business apps to their employees without going through Apple's tightly controlled App Store.


Using so-called enterprise developer certificates, these pirate operations are providing modified versions of popular apps to consumers, enabling them to stream music without ads and to circumvent fees and rules in games, depriving Apple and legitimate app makers of revenue.


By doing so, the pirate app distributors are violating the rules of Apple's developer programs, which only allow apps to be distributed to the general public through the App Store.

Uttar Pradesh is crucial for political parties as it sends 80 members to the Lok Sabha. The ruling BJP-led coalition won 73 seats in the state in the 2014 general elections, and again stamped its political dominance in the 2017 assembly elections by winning a three-fourth majority. This will, however, be the first time that BJP will face the combined force of three regional heavyweights in statewide elections. BJP, however, lost bypolls in Uttar Pradeshs Gorakhpur and Phulpur, two of its bastions, in 2018 to the regional alliance.


The western region of the state goes to the polls on 11 April in the first phase of general elections. In the 2014 Lok Sabha and 2017 assembly polls, BJP had won most of the seats from the region. The dominance of BJP in the state prompted the three parties to contest the elections jointly.

The Realme U1 was launched on Wednesday in India. While the phone boasts of MediaTeks flagship Helio P70 processor, it is also priced in the same category as the Redmi Note 6 Pro. However, Vivo and Oppo also launched their newest sub ? 15,000 smartphones earlier this week. This makes up for an exciting (and inevitable) comparison. Heres how the four smartphones stand against each other.


All phones except the Note 6 Pro have glossy rear panels. The Redmi Note 6 Pro features an all-Aluminium body. The main difference between the glossy backs of the Realme U1, Oppo A7 and Vivo Y95 lies in colour schemes and the optical trickerythe material is the same i.e. polycarbonate resin.


Realme U1 goes for a mirror finish, while the Oppo A7 goes for vertical grooves that reflect light in different directions. The Vivo Y95 has a dual-tone gradient with metallic finish that give a starry appearance. Polycarbonate is more durable than glass as plastic is more shatter resistant.

"Satyajit Ray was a legendary filmmaker who not just influenced directors and actors in India, but artistes across the world


 On Rays 98th birth anniversary, Sahapedia looks at the Bengali filmmakers relationship with two influential women Indira Gandhi and Marie Setonwho recognised and supported his genius


As India sought to rebuild itself post Independence, its filmmakers found patronage from a rather unusual and enthusiastic quarterfilm connoisseurs and cinephiles such as Jawahar Lal Nehru and Indira Gandhiwho helped them reach the global arena


 The iconic Bengali filmmaker Satyajit Ray, who placed India on the global film map firmly with his landmark debut movie Pather Panchali (1955), was a product of such patronage


 Rays early supporters were two influential womenIndira Gandhi, the first female prime minister of India, and Marie Seton, a family friend of the Nehrus and a British film consultant, who had been invited to India in the 1950s to assist the government with the making and promotion of films after penning a biography of the Russian director Sergei Eisenstein


 In 1952, she brought one of her family friends, Indo-French director Jahangir Bhownagary to India to launch the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) under the Films Division

So we are going to have to deal with that.""


Contrary to futuristic fears of super-intelligent"" robots taking control, the real dangers of our tech era have crept in more prosaically  often in the form of tech innovations we welcomed for making life more convenient .


Part of experts concern about the leap into connecting every home device to the internet and letting computers do our work is that the technology is still buggy and influenced by human errors and prejudices. Uber and Tesla were investigated for fatal self-driving car crashes in March, IBM came under scrutiny for working with New York City police to build a facial recognition system that can detect ethnicity, and Amazon took heat for supplying its own flawed facial recognition service to law enforcement agencies.


In some cases, opposition to the tech industrys rush to apply its newest innovations to questionable commercial uses has come from its own employees. Google workers helped scuttle the companys Pentagon drone contract, and workers at Amazon, Microsoft and Salesforce sought to cancel their companies contracts to supply tech services to immigration authorities.

"The impact will vary. Rising oil prices will hurt household income and spending and it could accelerate inflation. As the worlds biggest importer of oil, China is vulnerable, and many countries in Europe also rely on imported energy. Seasonal effects will also impact. With the Northern Hemisphere summer approaching, consumers can switch energy sources and scale back usage. A slowing world economy will also hurt demand and by extension keep a lid on prices.


For a sustained hit to growth, economists say oil would need to hold above $100. It also depends on dollar strength or weakness, given crude is priced in greenbacks. Analysis by Oxford Economics found that Brent at $100 per barrel by the end of 2019 means the level of global gross domestic product would be 0.6 percent lower than currently projected by end-2020, with inflation on average 0.7 percentage points higher.


We see increased risks of significantly higher oil prices,"" Oxford economists John Payne and Gabriel Sterne wrote in a note. In the short-run, it is likely the supply impact will be offset by higher production elsewhere, but the market is tightening and all it would take is one more shock to supply and oil could reach $100.""


An upending of global oil trade around the Iran-Trump spat could continue to have a sizable impact on financial markets, as the affected supply is as much as 800,000 barrels a day. Uncertainties around availability have already whipsawed oil markets. And the political sensitivities of these developments have other markets bracing for volatility.",impact vary rising oil price hurt household income spending could accelerate inflation worlds biggest importer oil china vulnerable many country europe also rely imported energy seasonal effect also impact northern hemisphere summer approaching consumer switch energy source scale back usage slowing world economy also hurt demand extension keep lid price sustained hit growth economist say oil would need hold 100 also depends dollar strength weakness given crude priced greenback analysis oxford economics found brent 100 per barrel end 2019 mean level global gross domestic product would 06 percent lower currently projected end2020 inflation average 07 percentage point higher we see increased risk significantly higher oil price oxford economist john payne gabriel sterne wrote note in shortrun likely supply impact offset higher production elsewhere market tightening would take one shock supply oil could reach 100 upending global oil trade around irantrump spat could continue sizable impact financial market affected supply much 800000 barrel day uncertainty around availability already whipsawed oil market political sensitivity development market bracing volatility,3

"Lawmakers are still hashing out how to define small excerpts of stories and whether individual words should be covered by the copyright rules, according to an EU official who asked not to be identified. The rules would also require Google and Facebook to actively prevent music, videos and other copyrighted content from appearing on their platforms if rights holders didn't grant them a license.


Despite the delay, an agreement is possible in the next few months, two EU officials said. If there's no accord by the spring, when European Parliament elections are held, the process would be delayed until later this year.


As with many divisive issues in European regulation, the problem is the small print. When the commission first unveiled draft rules, it proposed letting publishers waive their rights to demand payment from news-aggregation services. The European Parliament introduced a provision last year that raises concerns among some small publishers that they wont be able to let Google distribute their content online free of charge.


The impact of a Google News withdrawal on publishers who rely on the search giant for traffic to their sites is unclear. Google shut its news service in Spain in 2014 after the country passed a law requiring Spanish publications to charge aggregators for displaying excerpts of stories. Publishers must claim compensation for the reuse of fragments of text whether they want to or not.


The Spanish law led to small publishers losing about 13% of their web traffic, according to a 2017 study released by the Spanish Association of Publishers of Periodical Publications. That translates to a cost of at least 9 million euros ($10.2 million), the study estimated.",lawmaker still hashing define small excerpt story whether individual word covered copyright rule according eu official asked identified rule would also require google facebook actively prevent music video copyrighted content appearing platform right holder didnt grant license despite delay agreement possible next month two eu official said there accord spring european parliament election held process would delayed later year many divisive issue european regulation problem small print commission first unveiled draft rule proposed letting publisher waive right demand payment newsaggregation service european parliament introduced provision last year raise concern among small publisher wont able let google distribute content online free charge impact google news withdrawal publisher rely search giant traffic site unclear google shut news service spain 2014 country passed law requiring spanish publication charge aggregator displaying excerpt story publisher must claim compensation reuse fragment text whether want spanish law led small publisher losing 13 web traffic according 2017 study released spanish association publisher periodical publication translates cost least 9 million euro 102 million study estimated,1

TikToks popularity is evident from the fact that its parentsix-year-old Bytedance that also owns of news aggregator Toutiaois currently valued at $75 billion against Uber Inc.s $72 billion, according to CB Insights. ByteDance plans to invest $1 billion in India over the next three years, the Press Trust of India reported Friday.

"Voice Recognition: The speech recognition market is expected to grow from $1.1 billion in 2017 to $6.9 billion by 2025. With support for voice assistants being built into all kinds of gadgets, users will eventually not have to rely on physical remote controls-


According to a MarketsandMarkets report, the eSIM market is estimated to grow from $253.8 million in 2018 to $978.3 million in 2023. In India, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd have already started providing eSIM services.


A market report by Beecham Research claims that an industry-wide adoption and deployment of the eSIM will lead to 34% higher market growth in the mobile industry by 2020.


Voice as an interface: The advancements in machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) have made conversing with voice assistants less frustrating. They are slowly getting better at understanding the context and intent of people.


With support for these assistants being built into all kinds of gadgetsspeakers to TVsusers will eventually not have to rely on physical remote controls anymore. A voice command from anywhere will get things done in a jiffy. Research firm Tractica has predicted that the voice and speech recognition market is expected to grow from $1.1 billion in 2017 to $6.9 billion by 2025.

"The Samsonite campaign is a smart example of bringing a social message and product together but there are multiple brand categories that will not work like that,"" said Naresh Gupta, strategy head and managing partner at advertising agency Bang In The Middle.


A clutch of brands such as DB Corp. Ltd-owned radio brand 94.3 My FM, food delivery startup Swiggy, movie ticket booking platform BookMyShow, and KFC India are running various campaigns to remind young voters to exercise their voting rights.


Brands need to be part of the cultural narrative and they need to have a point of view on whats happening in the country.

"Artificial intelligence-driven engines are learning more about consumer behaviourthe more the AI engine knows about you, the better recommendation it will be able to provide along with customized emotional or economic benefits from the providers. Mobility startup Mobacar, for instance, uses machine learning to predict the mode of transport and type of vehicle a traveller may want and pushes only relevant offers, while travel assistant Mezi uses natural language processing to provide a personalized experience to business travellers who usually are short of time.


Biometrics can help simplify the journey and may replace the identity documents, maybe even passports, through fingerprint, facial or iris recognition at customs, hotels and airline check-ins.


Robotics is being used in automating monotonous tasks. Customer service robots already exist at Munich, Bologna and Geneva airports. Social robot and digital concierge FRAnny, deployed at Frankfurt Airport, answers questions about the gate for airline departures, can direct passengers to specific restaurants and help them access the airports free Wi-Fi. In Sasebo, Japan, a hotel is run almost entirely by robots enabling check-in at reception and luggage transfer to rooms.


Blockchain is also seen as a future disruptor of the entire travel value chain through increased disintermediation and democratization. It has the potential to remove intermediaries and balance the bargaining power in the hands of online travel agencies (OTAs), and inventory owners. For instance, Winding Tree is a decentralized travel distribution platform for inventory tracking and Travala is a travel booking marketplace that ledgerizes and decentralizes the hotel industry, allowing users to add rooms backed by smart contracts.


These new age technologies will also have implications related to customer data, usage, storage and accessibility and are bound to give rise to data and privacy regulations.


While the customer is evolving and being pampered by the choices provided by these new age intermediaries between customer and hotel, the rise of other inventory providers like online travel aggregators, metasearch agencies and digital tour guides will also ensure that the business model on the supply side shifts. Today hotels and other inventory owners have less bargaining power at the hands of large online travel agencies (OTAs) but are coping as the cost of customer acquisition has reduced. But they are constantly grappling with the question of how much commission they should give away to the online travel aggregators.",artificial intelligencedriven engine learning consumer behaviourthe ai engine know better recommendation able provide along customized emotional economic benefit provider mobility startup mobacar instance us machine learning predict mode transport type vehicle traveller may want push relevant offer travel assistant mezi us natural language processing provide personalized experience business traveller usually short time biometrics help simplify journey may replace identity document maybe even passport fingerprint facial iris recognition custom hotel airline checkins robotics used automating monotonous task customer service robot already exist munich bologna geneva airport social robot digital concierge franny deployed frankfurt airport answer question gate airline departure direct passenger specific restaurant help access airports free wifi sasebo japan hotel run almost entirely robot enabling checkin reception luggage transfer room blockchain also seen future disruptor entire travel value chain increased disintermediation democratization potential remove intermediary balance bargaining power hand online travel agency otas inventory owner instance winding tree decentralized travel distribution platform inventory tracking travala travel booking marketplace ledgerizes decentralizes hotel industry allowing user add room backed smart contract new age technology also implication related customer data usage storage accessibility bound give rise data privacy regulation customer evolving pampered choice provided new age intermediary customer hotel rise inventory provider like online travel aggregator metasearch agency digital tour guide also ensure business model supply side shift today hotel inventory owner less bargaining power hand large online travel agency otas coping cost customer acquisition reduced constantly grappling question much commission give away online travel aggregator,1

"The chipmaker brought separate patent suits against Apple in Germany and China, winning bans on the sale of some models of the iPhone. Photo: Reuters


Qualcomm argues the US simply has its facts wrong and has failed to demonstrate any evidence of anti-competitive behaviour by the chipmaker against its rivals


Two years after the US Federal Trade Commission sued Qualcomm Inc., unleashing a series of existential challenges to the companys business model, the chipmaker is about to get its chance to square the record.


Lawyers for the regulatory agency and the company are set to begin presenting arguments on January 4 in a 10-day jury trial over claims that Qualcomm is abusing its strength in the market for smartphone components to force Apple Inc. and others to pay inflated license fees.


While the two sides have said theyre in settlement negotiations, US District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, refused to delay proceedings and narrowed the scope of Qualcomms arguments in pre-trial rulings.


The case challenges San Diego-based Qualcomms business model, casting a shadow over one of the fundamental reasons its been so successful in the smartphone era. Losing to the FTC would threaten billions of dollars the company makes in licensing fees, which have been used to develop better chips and invent technology. Any cut to Qualcomms ability to pay for industry-leading research and design jeopardizes its future competitiveness as well as its current profits.",chipmaker brought separate patent suit apple germany china winning ban sale model iphone photo reuters qualcomm argues u simply fact wrong failed demonstrate evidence anticompetitive behaviour chipmaker rival two year u federal trade commission sued qualcomm inc unleashing series existential challenge companys business model chipmaker get chance square record lawyer regulatory agency company set begin presenting argument january 4 10day jury trial claim qualcomm abusing strength market smartphone component force apple inc others pay inflated license fee two side said theyre settlement negotiation u district judge lucy koh san jose california refused delay proceeding narrowed scope qualcomms argument pretrial ruling case challenge san diegobased qualcomms business model casting shadow one fundamental reason its successful smartphone era losing ftc would threaten billion dollar company make licensing fee used develop better chip invent technology cut qualcomms ability pay industryleading research design jeopardizes future competitiveness well current profit,1

"At Wipro, the posts being examined include not only public posts but also those that are shared privately to a limited set of a user's friends. (Reuters)


Hyderabad: Over the past year, a team of as many as 260 contract workers in Hyderabad, India has ploughed through millions of Facebook Inc photos, status updates and other content posted since 2014.


These include the subject of the post - is it food, for example, or a selfie or an animal? What is the occasion - an everyday activity or major life event? And what is the author's intention - to plan an event, to inspire, to make a joke?


The work is aimed at understanding how the types of things users post on its services are changing, Facebook said. That can help the company develop new features, potentially increasing usage and ad revenue.


Details of the effort were provided by multiple employees at outsourcing firm Wipro Ltd over several months. The workers spoke on condition of anonymity due to fear of retaliation by the Indian firm. Facebook later confirmed many details of the project. Wipro declined to comment and referred all questions to Facebook.


The Wipro work is among about 200 content labeling projects that Facebook has at any time, employing thousands of people globally, company officials told Reuters.


Many projects are aimed at ""training"" the software that determines what appears in users' news feeds and powers the artificial intelligence underlying many other features.


""It's a core part of what you need,"" said Nipun Mathur, the director of product management for AI at Facebook. ""I don't see the need going away.""

"However, many users also approach third-party repair shops in electronic hubs like Delhis Nehru Place and Lamington Road in Mumbai. The reason: these shops charge a lot less and have more affordable replacement options for customers. For instance, the cost of getting the display replaced on the Galaxy Note 9 is ?13,840 (according to Samsungs support webpage) with service charges on top, while in third-party shops one can get a copy at less than half the price.


Third-party repair shops have both original parts as well as copy. The original parts cost ?2,000 to ?3,000 less than what authorized service centres charge. That is because they provide warranty for their replacements and third party shops dont. The copy, which is sourced from China, costs many times less,"" explains Kailash Babu from Ankit Communication, a smartphone repair shop in Nehru Place. Besides, third-party stores try to repair the faulty parts rather than replacing whole components, thus saving consumers some money.


However, these attempts can often result in a harrowing experience. The phone may not offer the same level of experience and in some cases may stop working as well. Moreover, user data could be stolen and misused. For instance, in December 2018, several iPhone 8 users who had their handsets repaired by a third-party store found the display was not working after updating to iOS 11.3. According to researchers from Israels Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, third-party repair shops can record keyboard input and even exploit the operating system (OS) kernel on the handset by embedding a malicious chip in the third-party replacement screen.",however many user also approach thirdparty repair shop electronic hub like delhis nehru place lamington road mumbai reason shop charge lot less affordable replacement option customer instance cost getting display replaced galaxy note 9 13840 according samsungs support webpage service charge top thirdparty shop one get copy less half price thirdparty repair shop original part well copy original part cost 2000 3000 less authorized service centre charge provide warranty replacement third party shop dont copy sourced china cost many time less explains kailash babu ankit communication smartphone repair shop nehru place besides thirdparty store try repair faulty part rather replacing whole component thus saving consumer money however attempt often result harrowing experience phone may offer level experience case may stop working well moreover user data could stolen misused instance december 2018 several iphone 8 user handset repaired thirdparty store found display working updating io 113 according researcher israels bengurion university negev thirdparty repair shop record keyboard input even exploit operating system o kernel handset embedding malicious chip thirdparty replacement screen,1
"However, the BJPs growth in the state over the last few years is quite visible, more so after the 2017 panchayat polls, when the partys performance, aided by consistent ground work done by two Odia central ministerspetroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan and tribal affairs minister Jual Oramgot national attention.

"Arjun votes from Hamirpur district which is part of Uttar Pradeshs drought-prone Bundelkhand region. In this election, an alliance between the Samajwadi Party (SP) led by Akhilesh Yadav and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) led by Mayawati is trying to re-establish their roots and counter the Bharatiya Janata Partys (BJPs) narrative which is banking on the popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and government schemes including Swachh Bharat Mission and Ujjwala.


Bundelkhand accounts for four Lok Sabha constituencies  Jhansi, Hamirpur, Jalaun and Banda. Other than Banda, the remaining three constituencies go to polls in the fourth phase on Monday. Of the 13 seats going to polls in Uttar Pradesh on Monday, BJP won 11 in 2014, including Union minister Uma Bharti from Jhansi, who has decided not to contest this time. Voters across the constituencies of Jhansi, Jalaun and Hamirpur feel that while there has been an improvement in law and order, the government has not been able to fulfil promises made to farmers and to increase jobs.


The area is of key importance to the BJP as it had won all four seats from here in 2014. Keeping its momentum going in the assembly elections, the BJP won all the 19 assembly segments across the four Lok Sabha constituencies in Bundelkhand. The party has been reaching out to other backward classes (OBCs) to gain ground.

"A generation of our best engineers are spending their productive output on building behavioural nudges that manipulate users to stay on their platforms. Moving to a model where users pay for what they use could help us focus our efforts on ideas that meaningfully improve society.


But the innovation deficit could be more systemic. The economist Robert Gordon, a vocal proponent of this view, has argued that the golden age of technological innovation is behind us. To support his thesis, Gordon points out that before 1750s, there was virtually no economic growth. Inventions like the steam engine, railroads and telephone drove economic growth over the past 250 years. This growth spurt was an anomaly and there isnt any reason to blindly believe well continue to find new ways to grow.


His analyses suggests that most of the technology changes that improved our quality of life had taken place by the first half of the twentieth century. These include the internal combustion engine, electricity, air travel, indoor plumbing and kitchen appliances. We have just been incrementally improving them ever since.


The Boeing 707 was introduced in 1958. Since then, air travel hasnt gotten that much faster. The kitchen in an average Western home largely resembles the kitchen from 1950s, albeit with more energy efficient appliances. Using productivity data for the past few decades, Gordon concludes that the major breakthroughs of recent timespersonal computing and the internetdid improve our lives by automating tedious manual tasks. But the gains arent nearly as dramatic.


In particular, since the 2000s, most of the technological innovation has centered on entertainment and communication devices that are smaller and smarter. While our lives are certainly a lot richer, improving consumer utility isnt on the same scale as inventing electricity. Finally, the growth of developing economies like India and China isnt due to new innovation; these countries are merely catching-up and adopting technologies that have already been invented.


The end of innovation"" thesis is appealing but it doesnt explain why markers for innovation show an upward trend. The number of patents filed have continued to rise in the past few decades and adoption time for newer technologies has gotten shorter.


Instead of no more ideas, perhaps ideas are just getting harder to find. As another economist, Tyler Cowen suggests, in the past few centuries, we have plucked all the low hanging fruit. Innovation from here on out will get harder.


There is good evidence to support this view. Nicholas Bloom, an economist at Stanford University, and his colleagues studied research productivity across a variety of sectors. Their findings suggest that the cost of finding new ideas has increased, both financially and in the number of researchers needed. In aggregate, they compute that research productivity falls in half every 13 years. To maintain a constant growth in per capita GDP, the US must double the amount of research effort every 13 years.


Moores law highlights this tension well. A central tenet of the computer industry for the past fifty years, the law states that the number of transistors on a chip doubles every year while the costs are halved. Despite predictions of its impending end, the trend has continued to hold making computers faster and cheaper. But it comes at a cost. The number of researchers required to double chip density today is more than 18 times larger than the number required in the early 1970s.",generation best engineer spending productive output building behavioural nudge manipulate user stay platform moving model user pay use could help u focus effort idea meaningfully improve society innovation deficit could systemic economist robert gordon vocal proponent view argued golden age technological innovation behind u support thesis gordon point 1750s virtually economic growth invention like steam engine railroad telephone drove economic growth past 250 year growth spurt anomaly isnt reason blindly believe well continue find new way grow analysis suggests technology change improved quality life taken place first half twentieth century include internal combustion engine electricity air travel indoor plumbing kitchen appliance incrementally improving ever since boeing 707 introduced 1958 since air travel hasnt gotten much faster kitchen average western home largely resembles kitchen 1950s albeit energy efficient appliance using productivity data past decade gordon concludes major breakthrough recent timespersonal computing internetdid improve life automating tedious manual task gain arent nearly dramatic particular since 2000s technological innovation centered entertainment communication device smaller smarter life certainly lot richer improving consumer utility isnt scale inventing electricity finally growth developing economy like india china isnt due new innovation country merely catchingup adopting technology already invented end innovation thesis appealing doesnt explain marker innovation show upward trend number patent filed continued rise past decade adoption time newer technology gotten shorter instead idea perhaps idea getting harder find another economist tyler cowen suggests past century plucked low hanging fruit innovation get harder good evidence support view nicholas bloom economist stanford university colleague studied research productivity across variety sector finding suggest cost finding new idea increased financially number researcher needed aggregate compute research productivity fall half every 13 year maintain constant growth per caput gdp u must double amount research effort every 13 year moores law highlight tension well central tenet computer industry past fifty year law state number transistor chip double every year cost halved despite prediction impending end trend continued hold making computer faster cheaper come cost number researcher required double chip density today 18 time larger number required early 1970s,1

"But herein lay a big challenge, too. Windows was designed to run on a PC platform, so porting it to a mobile platform that runs a mobile chipset required Microsoft to create a new version called the Windows 10S, which is fully compatible with apps from the Microsoft App Store, explains Andrew Chan, senior manager (systems marketing) at Asus. Although users can switch to Windows 10 Pro, programmes written for Windows 10 Pro have yet to be fully tested. As testing and verification continues, we expect greater adoption.""


When it comes to rewriting code for Intel and ARM chipsets, there are ways to cross-compile programmes from ARM to Intel. Writing and compiling code will always be an experimental and, occasionally, challenging endeavour that takes patience and skill, says Sachin Dev Duggal, founder and chief wizard at Engineer.ai, a tech start-up which is working on making software development simple.

"At the heart of Apple's shocking FaceTime bug, which allowed just about anyone to turn an iPhone into a live microphone, stands a 14-year-old boy who stumbled upon the eavesdropping flaw more than a week before Apple took action.


""The thing that surprised me the most was that this glitch happened in the first place,"" said Grant Thompson, a high school freshman in Tucson, Arizona. ""I'm only 14 and I found it by accident, instead of the people at Apple that get paid to find glitches.""


Not only that, but Grant and his mom said they spent a week unsuccessfully trying to get Apple to do something about the bug in its FaceTime group-chatting feature. The bug allowed callers to activate another person's microphone remotely even before the person has accepted or rejected the call.


""It took nine days for us to get a response,"" he said. ""My mom contacted them almost every single day through email, calling, faxing."" Of the fax, he jokes, ""I'm not even sure what that is. It's probably older than I am.""


This eavesdropping scare is over now that Apple has disabled group chats, but the problem could dog the company for much longer. New York state officials have opened a consumer rights investigation. Others are raising questions about how long it took Apple to address the bug.


In a statement Friday, Apple thanked the Thompsons as it announced that it has identified a fix and will release it next week.

"As the leader of opposition in the Lower House, Kharge is confident of delivering over 20 seats to his party


KALABURAGI (KARNATAKA): In Karnataka, there are only a handful of people who are referred to as solillada saradara"" (chieftain who has never lost) and 76-year-old Mallikarjun Kharge tops that list with 11 election victories -- nine in assembly polls and two parliamentary victories -- since 1972.


On 23 April, Kharge will be fighting his 12th electoral battle from Kalaburagi (Gulbarga), in the Hyderabad-Karnataka region, that many believe is one of his most difficult ones as he takes on his protege, Umesh Jadhav, a rebel Congress leader who defected to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).


As the leader of opposition in the Lower House, Kharge is confident of delivering over 20 seats to his party. In an hour-long chat, the veteran leader speaks about the forthcoming polls and its impact on the Janata Dal (Secular)-Congress coalition in the state, Rahul Gandhis chances of dethroning Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his own unfulfilled ambition of becoming Karnatakas chief minister.


Age has taken a toll this time and travelling by car becomes an ordeal for long distance but otherwise the election does not seem that difficult.

"I think AI is going to change every job and will take away jobs too. But that need not be a bad thing. If AI is creating goods at a lower cost by automating things, we should rejoice. Arthur C. Clarke, science fiction author, wrote in 2001 that the goal of technology should be full unemployment and not full employment, so we all have time to be more creative. Humans historically believe that we have to work to be valuable.


That no longer has to be the case. Society can distribute the abundance that AI and robotics can make, allowing us to transition from a society-based on work, to a society based on creativity and exploration.


There are many people and companies that are trying to create open source AI. On the whole if we can share the ideas, it would allow more people to innovate instead of coming inside closed communities to take advantage of them. The strength of these algorithms is not just in the software but in the huge amounts of data that they review. Companies like Facebook and Google have huge amounts of data and they are not sharing it. We need to find ways to make sure that data is used for the sake of the whole community and not just for the benefit of these companies. That comes to the very important point of the democratic oversight of these powerful companies. Though they are well intentioned and I have a great deal of admiration for their founders, they are not necessarily going to do things that are in the interest of the community. They may do things that will boost their share prices, which is why governments are talking about exercising control over the hi-tech companies.

"Los Angeles/New York: An android child struggles to control his emotions. Robots threaten to take away human jobs. And a voice-activated device ponders its own existence.


These dark themes were explored by this years Super Bowl commercials, with brands such as TurboTax, Olay and Sprint capitalizing on fears that technology is encroaching on our lives. The unspoken subject of many of the ads: Amazon.com Inc.s Alexa, an increasingly ubiquitous digital assistant sold by one of the worlds most powerful companies.


Amazon had its own commercial, where it poked fun at Alexa. The ad featured rejected ideas for the technology -- including a microwave, dog collar and hot tub -- and even depicted a massive power outage triggered by Alexa.


Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos also made an in-person appearance at the Super Bowl, where he was spotted with National Football League Commissioner Roger Goodell.


The Super Bowls advertisers included companies seeking to disrupt the TV industry. Alphabet Inc.s YouTube TV sponsored the games kickoff show, and Hulu and Netflix aired commercials.

"Whats helping these creators is that companies like LG, Samsung, Microsoft, Apple and Google have specifically-highlighted features in their devices that cater to such needs. For instance, the Samsung Galaxy S10 has specific camera features that are meant for creators. Similarly, LGs V series devices have often been marketed as phones that are suited for those who earn a living by making YouTube videos.


Rohit Gupta , who is one of the founders of The Creative Indians, has shot the entire fourth season of their show using the iPhone XS Max. We started our experiments with the iPhone 8 and then X and eventually XS Max. We have done a run-through from the iPhone 7 to the XS Max,"" he says, adding that when they shoot, they dont look at the phone as a replacement for the camera but try to shoot within the pros of the phones camera"". According to him, while phones may not allow the versatility that traditional cameras do, they allow the creator to introduce a different language"", which he prefers.


To be sure, creators agree that its important to understand the limitations of mobile devices. For instance, Gupta says the smaller camera sensors on phones means you have to be more thorough with your lighting and throw that much more light on the sensor"". Also, phone cameras do not provide the depth that a full-fledged camera gives.


Similarly, Khan says that while his iPad works fine for his Instagram posts, he has had to move to the PC when designing billboards or other larger resolution images. This task is something that will require proper professional software and tools.

"Gandhi has represented Amethi for three consecutive terms. BJP has fielded Irani again, a strong orator who tears into the Gandhi family each time she takes the stage. Nepotism, corruption and the neglect of the constituency are her main talking points.


The choice of Irani is significant because the party wants to focus on how this high-profile constituency of the senior-most Congress leader is in bad shape. She talks about development and dynastic rule, and puts the focus on things that have been ignored for so long in Amethi,"" said a senior BJP leader from the state.


She appeals to a section of voters who feel the constituency has been ignored and needs a non-Congress, non-Gandhi representative. Amethi is worse than it used to be. We have nothing compared to the kind of work that Modi has done. Irani is a strong candidate and will do well this time,"" said Heera Soni, a jewellery shop owner in Amethi.


Across UP, and large parts of north India, Congress inability to firm up alliances has impacted its chances and left voters uncertain. In UP, Congress is not part of the Samjawadi Party-Bahujan Samaj Party combine. In contrast, BJP had a fairly smooth ride with its allies. In states like Bihar, it ceded space to allies in order to create formidable combinations.


It is a make or break election for the Congress. They have staked everything on it. Rahul Gandhi needs to win Amethi and Congress needs to do well in the Lok Sabha elections. If one or the other does not happen, it will cast a shadow on the future of both,"" said Ram Prasad, who supplies hardware material in Amethi.


After losing to the BJP in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Congress faced its roughest electoral run in the following years.

"Investors greeted the announcements, mostly launching lower-margin businesses, with a lukewarm response. Facebook shares ended down 0.7 percent on Tuesday.


Zuckerberg in March promised changes to the advertising-driven social media company, which has come under regulatory scrutiny over propaganda on its platform and violations of users' data privacy.


He identified private messaging, short-lasting stories and small groups as the fastest-growing areas of online communication. In the last three years, the number of people using Facebook's WhatsApp has almost doubled.


Building up those more intimate and encrypted forms of communication could also reduce pressure on Facebook to clean up misinformation and abusive content. In the wake of its scandals, the company has spent heavily on tools to catch banned material.


The social media company is now working on ""LightSpeed"" in order to make its Messenger app smaller and faster.


Facebook will also introduce a desktop version of Messenger for Mac and Windows and launch a feature called ""Product Catalogue"" for WhatsApp Business. The desktop app will be available this fall.

"Supply creates its own demand, says one adage by French economist Jean-Baptiste Say. But, in the case of government shares, supply is proving to be a nuisance for shareholders of public sector enterprises (PSEs).


The Nifty PSE index is down 22% in the past two years, as compared to a 16% rise in the Nifty 500 index. Stocks in the Nifty PSE are down between 15.2% and 41% in the past two years. Of course, the financial performance of firms run by the government is nothing to write home about, which is in itself a major reason for the underperformance. But an increase in free float is a concern as well.


A case in point is the Coal India Ltd stock, which is down 34.9% in the past two years.

"Further, the governments 100 smart cities project, Digital India programme, Make in India project and Smart Energy project are expected to proliferate the deployment of IoT devices in India. The government is also partnering with start-ups and mentoring them to develop innovative solutions in areas such as education tech, healthcare tech, e-governance, finance and agriculture. Besides, sensors inside offshore drilling rigs constantly monitor the performance of gas turbines for damages as well as regulate the pressure of the oil below the ocean surface.


The complexity of the IoT system, however, requires essential rules on data management, security, latency and reliability issues. Besides, IoT will require AI as a companion since IoT will produce a treasure trove of big data that will need to be intelligently analysed with machine learning to draw meaningful insights for businesses.


Three-dimensional (3-D) printing is changing the face of traditional manufacturing. Today, 3-D printers not only make jewellery and toothbrushes but also football boots, racing-car parts, custom-designed cakes, human organs, houses, aeroplane parts and even more efficient lithium-ion batteries. And yes! They even provide blueprints for 3D-printed guns.


Last month, a US federal judge blocked defdist.org from sharing blueprints of 3-D guns. However, the ruling came after thousands of people had already downloaded blueprints for these weapons. As a precautionary measure, some 3-D printing firms are now using gun-blocking software to deter people from printing functional guns, according to a 14 August report by radio programme producer NPR.


According to 6Wresearch, Indias 3-D printer market is projected to touch $79 million by 2021. The growth triggers include the low cost of manufacturing, increased applications and the Make In India campaign. In India, 3-D printers have been used in medical, architecture, automotive, industrial, aerospace, military and other applications, where automotive application accounts for the largest revenue and volume share.


Four years ago, for instance, a team of Indian plastic surgeons at the Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (Jipmer) in Puducherry restored the deformed skull of a three-year-old girl to its original shape with the help of a 3-D printer that was sourced from a Mumbai-based 3-D printer maker, Divide By Zero Technologies. Jipmer now has its own 3-D Printer.


3-D printing belongs to a class of techniques known as additive manufacturing, or building objects layer by layer. The most common household 3D-printing process involves a print head"", which allows for any material from plastic (and now metals too) to be extruded or squirted through a nozzle. To be sure, theres also the concept of 4-D printing, which allows materials to self-assemble"" into 3-D structures, and which was initially proposed by Skylar Tibbits of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in April 2013.


Globally, the 3-D printer market is expected to be worth $32.78 billion by 2023, according to research firm Markets and Markets. The aerospace and defence vertical, according to the report, held the largest share of the global 3-D printing market in 2016.",governments 100 smart city project digital india programme make india project smart energy project expected proliferate deployment iot device india government also partnering startup mentoring develop innovative solution area education tech healthcare tech egovernance finance agriculture besides sensor inside offshore drilling rig constantly monitor performance gas turbine damage well regulate pressure oil ocean surface complexity iot system however requires essential rule data management security latency reliability issue besides iot require ai companion since iot produce treasure trove big data need intelligently analysed machine learning draw meaningful insight business threedimensional 3d printing changing face traditional manufacturing today 3d printer make jewellery toothbrush also football boot racingcar part customdesigned cake human organ house aeroplane part even efficient lithiumion battery yes even provide blueprint 3dprinted gun last month u federal judge blocked defdistorg sharing blueprint 3d gun however ruling came thousand people already downloaded blueprint weapon precautionary measure 3d printing firm using gunblocking software deter people printing functional gun according 14 august report radio programme producer npr according 6wresearch indias 3d printer market projected touch 79 million 2021 growth trigger include low cost manufacturing increased application make india campaign india 3d printer used medical architecture automotive industrial aerospace military application automotive application account largest revenue volume share four year ago instance team indian plastic surgeon jawaharlal institute postgraduate medical education research jipmer puducherry restored deformed skull threeyearold girl original shape help 3d printer sourced mumbaibased 3d printer maker divide zero technology jipmer 3d printer 3d printing belongs class technique known additive manufacturing building object layer layer common household 3dprinting process involves print head allows material plastic metal extruded squirted nozzle sure theres also concept 4d printing allows material selfassemble 3d structure initially proposed skylar tibbits massachusetts institute technology mit april 2013 globally 3d printer market expected worth 3278 billion 2023 according research firm market market aerospace defence vertical according report held largest share global 3d printing market 2016,1

The worry is that the pressure on Bharti Infratels earnings is likely to worsen. These concerns emerge from two fronts. One is continuing consolidation in the telecom sector. The Vodafone Idea Ltd combine continues to rationalise its telecom sites. After exiting the overlapping sites, the focus now is on reducing the presence in low-revenue generating sites.


The second is Reliance Jios plans to float its tower infrastructure business into a separate entity. Analysts fear such a move can curb incremental tenancies from Jio.

"What lies ahead for organizations?: Experts at Checkpoint believe there will be more targeted attacks in the future as cybercriminals are eyeing higher returns. Cloud infrastructure will face more Cryptojacking attacks (unauthorized use of someone elses computer to mine cryptocurrency) as hackers will require assets that offer greater CPU capacity for faster mining and the scalability of cloud services will allow them to do that. Also, many organizations are still not fully aware of its crippling effects, notes Checkpoint. Attacks on mobile devices are also expected to grow, but instead of multiple forms of attacks, cybercriminals may use an all-in-one mobile malware with multiple capabilities, it notes. Further, with artificial intelligence (AI) becoming an integral part of operations of many organizations, cybercriminals will try to manipulate AI systems. IoT devices, on their part, are predicted to remain the weakest link in security as they are harder to secure.


Moreover, following the roll-out of general data protection regulations in the European Union, more countries are going to come up with their own data protection laws. This means organizations wont be able to brush away any data breaches involving user data and will have to make them public.",lie ahead organization expert checkpoint believe targeted attack future cybercriminals eyeing higher return cloud infrastructure face cryptojacking attack unauthorized use someone elses computer mine cryptocurrency hacker require asset offer greater cpu capacity faster mining scalability cloud service allow also many organization still fully aware crippling effect note checkpoint attack mobile device also expected grow instead multiple form attack cybercriminals may use allinone mobile malware multiple capability note artificial intelligence ai becoming integral part operation many organization cybercriminals try manipulate ai system iot device part predicted remain weakest link security harder secure moreover following rollout general data protection regulation european union country going come data protection law mean organization wont able brush away data breach involving user data make public,1

Anytime someone is collecting where you are, that means it could go to someone else who could find you when you dont want to be found,"" she said. Widespread access to location data associated with Alexa user recordings would set up a big red flag for me.""

It was able to wade through most apps and tasks with ease and can even handle games like FIFA Mobile and Real Cricket 2019 very well.


Xiaomi has been a bit stingy in the memory department, though. The entry-level variant offers just 2GB RAM, which can be a bit low for users who like to multi-task on their phones.


Users can always expand the storage with a micro-SD card and Xiaomi has kept the card slot separate from the dual-SIM slots, so one can use all three simultaneously.

Those cases are aimed at forcing Apple to settle the broader dispute. Thats not going to happen until the FTC case is out of the way, according to UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri.

"That means the real problem may be not so much WhatsApp the company or WhatsApp the product but something more fundamental  WhatsApp the idea.


When you offer everyone access to free and private communication, lots of wonderful things may happen  and WhatsApp has been a godsend to vulnerable populations like migrants, dissidents and political activists. But a lot of terrible things are bound to happen, too  and it might be impossible to eliminate the bad without muzzling the good.


In this light, WhatsApp is a powerful and permanent new reality and its problems arent likely to be solved as much as fitfully and sometimes unsatisfyingly managed. For better or worse, we are going to have to learn to live with it.


I thought WhatsApp would be a very dark place, a wild place, where all these conspiracy theories would be spreading and we wouldnt know what they were talking about,"" said Yasodara Córdova, a fellow at DigitalHKS, a center at Harvards Kennedy School that examines the role digital technologies play in government. Córdova has been working on Comprova, a fact-checking project to monitor social media sites during Brazils election.


What sets WhatsApp apart is speed and reach, Córdova said. In Brazil, more than 120 million people use the service, which is offered free as part of mobile internet plans (that is, using WhatsApp does not count against peoples data rate). As it does in its other big markets  India, South Africa, Saudi Arabia and much of Europe  WhatsApp functions in Brazil as an all-purpose communications tool. It is used for chatting and joking, for trading photos and memes, for news, for political activity and more.


Because of that centrality, Córdova argued, the problems on WhatsApp in Brazil were mainly a function of the countrys broken political and media environment.


For example, we dont really have public libraries in Brazil,"" she said. We dont have a lot of sources of what people would consider reliable information  and the lack of good sources of information reinforces their beliefs when they see something false on WhatsApp or Facebook.""",mean real problem may much whatsapp company whatsapp product something fundamental  whatsapp idea offer everyone access free private communication lot wonderful thing may happen  whatsapp godsend vulnerable population like migrant dissident political activist lot terrible thing bound happen  might impossible eliminate bad without muzzling good light whatsapp powerful permanent new reality problem arent likely solved much fitfully sometimes unsatisfyingly managed better worse going learn live i thought whatsapp would dark place wild place conspiracy theory would spreading wouldnt know talking said yasodara córdova fellow digitalhks center harvards kennedy school examines role digital technology play government córdova working comprova factchecking project monitor social medium site brazils election set whatsapp apart speed reach córdova said brazil 120 million people use service offered free part mobile internet plan using whatsapp count peoples data rate big market  india south africa saudi arabia much europe  whatsapp function brazil allpurpose communication tool used chatting joking trading photo meme news political activity centrality córdova argued problem whatsapp brazil mainly function countrys broken political medium environment for example dont really public library brazil said we dont lot source people would consider reliable information  lack good source information reinforces belief see something false whatsapp facebook,1

"The three services will, however, continue as stand alone apps, at least until end of this year or early 2020


Facebook is still in the early stages of the work and plans to complete it by the end of this year or in early 2020


After the changes, a Facebook user, for instance, will be able send an encrypted message to someone who has only a WhatsApp account


San Francisco: Mark Zuckerberg, Facebooks chief executive, plans to integrate the social networks messaging services  WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger  asserting his control over the companys sprawling divisions at a time when its business has been battered by scandals.


The move, described by four people involved in the effort, requires thousands of Facebook employees to reconfigure how WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger function at their most basic levels. While all three services will continue operating as stand-alone apps, their underlying messaging infrastructure will be unified, the people said. Facebook is still in the early stages of the work and plans to complete it by the end of this year or in early 2020, they said.


Zuckerberg has also ordered all of the apps to incorporate end-to-end encryption, the people said, a significant step that protects messages from being viewed by anyone except the participants in the conversation. After the changes take effect, a Facebook user could send an encrypted message to someone who has only a WhatsApp account, for example. Currently, that isnt possible because the apps are separate.


By stitching the apps infrastructure together, Zuckerberg wants to increase the utility of the social network, keeping its billions of users highly engaged inside its ecosystem. If people turn more regularly to Facebook-owned properties for texting, they may forgo rival messaging services, such as those from Apple and Google, said the people, who declined to be identified because the moves are confidential. If users interact more frequently with Facebooks apps, the company may also be able to build up its advertising business or add new services to make money, they said.",three service however continue stand alone apps least end year early 2020 facebook still early stage work plan complete end year early 2020 change facebook user instance able send encrypted message someone whatsapp account san francisco mark zuckerberg facebooks chief executive plan integrate social networks messaging service  whatsapp instagram facebook messenger  asserting control companys sprawling division time business battered scandal move described four people involved effort requires thousand facebook employee reconfigure whatsapp instagram facebook messenger function basic level three service continue operating standalone apps underlying messaging infrastructure unified people said facebook still early stage work plan complete end year early 2020 said zuckerberg also ordered apps incorporate endtoend encryption people said significant step protects message viewed anyone except participant conversation change take effect facebook user could send encrypted message someone whatsapp account example currently isnt possible apps separate stitching apps infrastructure together zuckerberg want increase utility social network keeping billion user highly engaged inside ecosystem people turn regularly facebookowned property texting may forgo rival messaging service apple google said people declined identified move confidential user interact frequently facebooks apps company may also able build advertising business add new service make money said,1
"The Korean company suffered a black-eye with a previous major launch in 2016, when it recalled the Galaxy Note 7 after consumers reported issues with batteries that burst into flames. The worlds largest smartphone maker is counting on ground-breaking gadgets to propel growth and excite consumers as demand for mobile devices flattens. Pre-orders began Monday for a marquee device expected to usher in a wave of smartphones that can unfurl into tablets. The Galaxy Folds 7.3-inch screen teased how users can juggle three apps at once and view video with more clarity.


We have received a few reports regarding the main display on the samples provided. We will thoroughly inspect these units in person to determine the cause of the matter,"" Samsung said in an statement Thursday.


The companys shares slid more than 2 percent, outpacing a 1 percent fall in the countrys benchmark index.


In one of the more serious apparent flaws, the inner screen stopped working. First, the left side of the display went dark -- then the right side developed problems before also failing completely. Other reviewers reported similar issues, including flickering visuals and how the area around the central hinge lost viewable pixels.

"The new entrant at the I/O will be the new Pixel smartphones. If the leaks and reports are to be believed, Google might launch two new mid-range Pixel smartphones, starting at $399 with 5.6-inch and 6-inch screens. They will be driven by Qualcomms mid-range Snapdragon 670 or 710 octa-core chipsets. Googles Pixel 3 smartphones have been doing well in overseas markets, and according to Counterpoint Research, Google is now the 3rd premium smartphone vendor in the US.


However, the Pixel phones havent done well in emerging markets, including India, which is largely dominated by Samsung, OnePlus and Chinese OEMs. With the mid-range Pixel phones, Google stands a better chance in these markets.


Google recently started releasing developer previews for its next Android version in March, available only on Pixel smartphones, but the pubic beta is reserved for the IO event. It should also be available on more Android smartphones.

Fortnite's basic game mode matches 100 players in a fight for survival, where the last man (or woman) standing wins. The concert was placed in Pleasant Park, a location in the multiplayer shooting game, where players could watch the virtual performance and even dance or ""emote"" to the electronic beats.

"I think the only place where one could have a social as well as a commercial footprint is on YouTube. The other services are simply retailers, or social platforms. I think streaming is going to help create an explosive and fertile music industry, more than it is now in India. I think youre going to see what I consider the golden age of the music industry.


What do you think of the competition that you will face here, such as Gaana, Spotify, and Apple Music?


You will find competition in all good businesses. I look at other streaming services more like comrades in arms, in order to make a healthier Indian music business, shrinking the world, giving the opportunity to export Indian music, and providing the opportunity for more artists to make a living by making music.

"In August, Epic said it wouldnt distribute Fortnite through Googles Play Store, instead asking players to visit its own site and download a special launcher that would open the game on Android devices. The method allows Epic to avoid the commission fee, and its new store will work in a similar fashion. Still, the game maker will have to assure players that its app store is as secure as the ones operated by Apple and Google.


If Apple and Google are eventually forced to cut commissions to match Epics, it could severely impact profit, Schachter said. Though the companies dont break out financial information for their stores, research firm Sensor Tower said in a July report that people spent around $34 billion on the stores in the first half of 2018.",august epic said wouldnt distribute fortnite googles play store instead asking player visit site download special launcher would open game android device method allows epic avoid commission fee its new store work similar fashion still game maker assure player app store secure one operated apple google apple google eventually forced cut commission match epics could severely impact profit schachter said though company dont break financial information store research firm sensor tower said july report people spent around 34 billion store first half 2018,1
"Besides, the governments aggressive divestment spree in these past two years has constantly kept the supply taps open in many PSE counters. The chosen route of divestment has been either exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or open market sales, or follow-on share offerings.


The sales are often lapped up because of a discount offered, although institutional investors typically hedge their bets by taking short positions in the derivatives market. Soon after allotment, the position is flipped (bit.ly/2GFs22t), and anecdotal evidence suggests the majority of the chunk of the incremental free float is held by retail investors, either directly or through investments in mutual funds or EPFO (Employees Provident Fund Organisation).

"""There is no legal mechanism to stop misuse of facial recognition technology in India,"" Pavan Duggal, one of the nation's top cyberlaw experts, told IANS, adding that the Information Technology Act does not specially deal with misuse of this technology.


There is also not any blanket ban on the use of this technology, perhaps because of the benefits that could accrue from the proper usage of the technology that dramatically cuts down the amount of time needed for identifying people or objects in photos and video.


In April last year, for example, Delhi Police could identify almost 3,000 missing children in just four days during a trial of a facial recognition system.


While the benefits of the technology for law enforcement agencies in fighting crime and identifying missing people and also for the industry for business purposes cannot be denied, it is the misuse of the technology that can put the citizens of the country in trouble.",legal mechanism stop misuse facial recognition technology india pavan duggal one nation top cyberlaw expert told ians adding information technology act specially deal misuse technology also blanket ban use technology perhaps benefit could accrue proper usage technology dramatically cut amount time needed identifying people object photo video april last year example delhi police could identify almost 3000 missing child four day trial facial recognition system benefit technology law enforcement agency fighting crime identifying missing people also industry business purpose denied misuse technology put citizen country trouble,1

"The draft amendment proposes that intermediaries will have to hand over to governmentagencies any information that might be related to cyber security, national security and related with the investigation, prosecution or prevention of an offence, within 72 hours.


They will have to take down or disable content considered defamatory or against national security under Article 19 (2) of the Constitution within 24 hours on being notified by the appropriate government or its agency in addition to using automated tools to identify, remove and trace the origin of such content. Intermediaries with over 55 lakh users will be required to have a permanent registered office with physical address and a senior official who would be available for coordination with law enforcement agencies.


Microsoft notes that the problem MEITY is trying to address is of fake news. Existing regulations provide enough powers to work with social media platforms. There may be a case to bring out additional guidelines for certain types of intermediaries like social media platforms. There may also be a case to strengthen other laws which make the punishment of fake news and misuse of social media stringent. The focus should be on the perpetrators of the crime rather than the intermediaries,"" it has said in response to the guidelines. Regarding deployment of tools to proactively identify and remove unlawful content, Microsoft cautions that intermediaries will have to monitor all content passing through their systems for this, which is a violation of their individual privacy and right to freedom of expression. It will also be technically impractical due to the high cost of deploying such tech.

"The question is if Devgn and his team were as sensitive to the #MeToo movement as he emphasises in his statement, couldnt they have for once priortised morality over money? That would have definitely made a better statement than the one Devgn has released


If Bollywood is quick to laud its American counterparts significant actions against the accused in the #MeToo movement, how difficult was it for the De De Pyaar De team to take a leaf out of Hollywood director Ridley Scotts book? In November 2017, the director removed actor Kevin Spacey from All the Money in the World immediately after allegations of sexual harassment against him were reported even as the film was weeks away from its release and its trailers were already out


 He even called it a business decision because he understood the toxicity from the allegations would infect the movie


 Guess, all the money in the world combined with heaps of arrogance is all that matters for Ajay Devgn and team


Even if one buys that it would have been a difficult call to remove Alok Nath because of monetary issues, despite T-Series being one of the most powerful production houses in the industry, what would have taken the team to issue a statement before the films promotions to condemn Nath and express its support to Vinta Nanda and all other survivors of sexual abuse? How much of Devgns precious time would have really gone in addressing the issue at the films trailer launch? How many tweets would he have really needed to speak about it even as he posted the films trailer and song links?

"The company also unveiled the Galaxy S10 5G, its first phone to work with 5G networks, which will have a jumbo 6.7-inch screen. In addition, it showed the Galaxy S10E, a model with a 5.8-inch display in a body that is smaller than the S9s, for people who prefer more compact devices.


Why would you want a bigger screen? When upgrading devices, people are increasingly gravitating toward phones with larger displays. Many feel that they are getting more bang for the buck with bigger screens, as studies have shown that people spend more time using apps, watching videos and browsing the web on big-screen phones.


Samsung first showed a prototype of its foldable phone at a conference for software developers last year. When folded up, it looked like a phone with a small screen, and once unfolded, the screen doubled in size.


At a media event on Wednesday, Samsung shared some details about its foldable device, Galaxy Fold. It has two screens  a smaller one and a larger one  with a hinge in the middle containing multiple interlocking gears. When folded up, the viewable screen measures 4.6 inches. Unfolding the device reveals its 7.3-inch display, which is the size of a tablet screen.


Samsung said it was working with Google, YouTube and others to develop apps that seamlessly transition between a single screen when folded up and the double screens in unfolded mode.


You may want a foldable phone if you love tablet computers. Plenty of people enjoy using tablets like Apples iPad and Amazons Fire Tablet for their roomy screens that are upward of 7 inches diagonally. That makes watching videos, reading books and playing games more enjoyable. The downside is that tablets are so large that they arent pocketable. A foldable phone, in theory, will let people have a tablet that can be folded up and carried in a pocket.


Other phone-makers are expected to jump on this trend. Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant, posted an image on Twitter this month teasing a foldable phone that will be unveiled at Mobile World Congress, the tech trade show in Barcelona, next week.


Foldable phones raise plenty of questions. When folded, the device becomes thicker in the pocket, which might make it bulky and uncomfortable. And its unclear whether making the displays bendable also makes them more fragile when dropped.",company also unveiled galaxy s10 5g first phone work 5g network jumbo 67inch screen addition showed galaxy s10e model 58inch display body smaller s9s people prefer compact device would want bigger screen upgrading device people increasingly gravitating toward phone larger display many feel getting bang buck bigger screen study shown people spend time using apps watching video browsing web bigscreen phone samsung first showed prototype foldable phone conference software developer last year folded looked like phone small screen unfolded screen doubled size medium event wednesday samsung shared detail foldable device galaxy fold two screen  smaller one larger one  hinge middle containing multiple interlocking gear folded viewable screen measure 46 inch unfolding device reveals 73inch display size tablet screen samsung said working google youtube others develop apps seamlessly transition single screen folded double screen unfolded mode may want foldable phone love tablet computer plenty people enjoy using tablet like apples ipad amazons fire tablet roomy screen upward 7 inch diagonally make watching video reading book playing game enjoyable downside tablet large arent pocketable foldable phone theory let people tablet folded carried pocket phonemakers expected jump trend huawei chinese telecommunication giant posted image twitter month teasing foldable phone unveiled mobile world congress tech trade show barcelona next week foldable phone raise plenty question folded device becomes thicker pocket might make bulky uncomfortable its unclear whether making display bendable also make fragile dropped,1
"On the face of it, India already has the basic foundations of a social security system. The public distribution system (PDS) provides a modicum of food and economic security to 67% of the population under the National Food Security Act, 2013. The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005 (MGNREGA) gives every rural household an opportunity to earn a basic wage on local public works, for up to 100 days in the year.


Social security pensions are in place for the elderly, widows and disabled persons. Maternity benefits of ?6,000 per child are a legal right of all Indian women under the National Food Security Act. Most children receive nutrition supplements and health services under the Mid Day Meal Scheme and the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS).


In practice, this safety net is still rife with holes. The PDS, despite considerable improvement in recent years, remains prone to leakages and exclusion errors. MGNREGA employment is far from guaranteed"", even to those who make a formal application for it. The coverage of social security pensions is still very patchy in many states. Maternity benefits have been illegally restricted, under the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY), to the first living child.


Further, all these schemes have low benefits: MGNREGA wage rates are below the minimum wage in many states; PMMVY benefits have been reduced (illegally again) to ?5,000 per child; the central governments contribution to social security pensions has stagnated at a measly ?200 per month for more than 12 years, and so on.


Against this background, the NYAY promise deserves serious consideration, as a means of plugging the holes and enhancing the benefits.


However, NYAY is both an opportunity and a threat. A well-planned NYAY, integrated with other foundations of Indias social security system, could be the next leap forward. But if NYAY displaces or undermines the existing foundations of social security without putting something better in place, it could also turn into a bull in the china shop.


For convenience, I shall use a prescriptive tone, but the intention is just to float some ideas for discussion.


FIRST, NYAY is best recognized for what it is: a massive pension scheme. The initial idea was to guarantee a minimum income ( ?12,000 per month according to Congress president Rahul Gandhi) by filling the gap, household-wise, between minimum income and actual income. This top-up"" approach, however, is impractical. On 25 March 2019, it gave way to the flat-rate"" approach, where all recipients get the same unconditional benefit of ?6,000 per month. In that case, NYAY might as well be seen as a pension schemetaking the word pension"" in the broad sense of a basic income allowance, not necessarily restricted to those who are unable to work.


SECOND, the 6x20"" formula ( ?6,000 a month for 20% of the population) should not be treated as a sacrosanct prescription, but as a benchmark for the commitment being made to this pension scheme. If something roughly equivalent but more effective is possible, it should be considered.",face india already basic foundation social security system public distribution system pd provides modicum food economic security 67 population national food security act 2013 mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee act 2005 mgnrega give every rural household opportunity earn basic wage local public work 100 day year social security pension place elderly widow disabled person maternity benefit 6000 per child legal right indian woman national food security act child receive nutrition supplement health service mid day meal scheme integrated child development service icds practice safety net still rife hole pd despite considerable improvement recent year remains prone leakage exclusion error mgnrega employment far guaranteed even make formal application coverage social security pension still patchy many state maternity benefit illegally restricted pradhan mantri matru vandana yojana pmmvy first living child scheme low benefit mgnrega wage rate minimum wage many state pmmvy benefit reduced illegally 5000 per child central governments contribution social security pension stagnated measly 200 per month 12 year background nyay promise deserves serious consideration mean plugging hole enhancing benefit however nyay opportunity threat wellplanned nyay integrated foundation indias social security system could next leap forward nyay displaces undermines existing foundation social security without putting something better place could also turn bull china shop convenience shall use prescriptive tone intention float idea discussion first nyay best recognized massive pension scheme initial idea guarantee minimum income 12000 per month according congress president rahul gandhi filling gap householdwise minimum income actual income topup approach however impractical 25 march 2019 gave way flatrate approach recipient get unconditional benefit 6000 per month case nyay might well seen pension schemetaking word pension broad sense basic income allowance necessarily restricted unable work second 6x20 formula 6000 month 20 population treated sacrosanct prescription benchmark commitment made pension scheme something roughly equivalent effective possible considered,0

"Similarly, this February, mobile security expert App Analyst discovered that iOS apps of some of the leading travel companies, such as Expedia, Hotels.com, Hollister and Air Canada, were secretly recording displays using a session-replay technology, which allows the app developer to capture every activity on the phones screen while the app was open. The recording was forwarded to analytics firm Glassbox for a deeper examination of how users were interacting with the apps so that they could identify the pain points and address them. The data gathering was carried out without the knowledge of users. In some cases, the apps were also found to be capturing passport info and credit card numbers of users as well.


One of the apps was by Air Canada, which had reported a data breach affecting more than 20,000 users in August 2018. Experts feel that if hackers had gained access to these sessions the situation could have been worse. There can be good reasons for session replay analytics as it allows those companies to see, for example, which of their options are most used so that they can then make them more accessible.

"In recent months, the messaging app has raised frightening new political and social dynamics. Photo: Bloomberg


The real problem may be not so much WhatsApp the company or WhatsApp the product but something more fundamental  WhatsApp the idea


Should the world worry about WhatsApp? Has it become a virulent new force in global misinformation and political trickery?


Or, rather, should the world rejoice about WhatsApp? After all, hasnt it provided a way for people everywhere to communicate securely with encrypted messages, beyond the reach of government surveillance?


In recent months, the messaging app, which is owned by Facebook and has more than 1.5 billion users worldwide, has raised frightening new political and social dynamics. In Brazil, which is in a bruising national election campaign, WhatsApp has become a primary vector for conspiracy theories and other political misinformation. WhatsApp played a similar role in Kenyas election last year. In India this year, false messages about child kidnappers went viral on WhatsApp, leading to mob violence that has killed dozens of people.


WhatsApp said it was working to reduce the spread of misinformation on the service. Critics charge that it is not doing enough  and there is some merit to their claims. Yet the deeper you dig into the problems, the more intractable they can come to seem, even if the company were moving heaven and earth to fix them.


Unlike Facebook, Twitter or Instagram, WhatsApp isnt a social network. It is mostly a bare-bones texting app in which most conversations are private and unmediated by any kind of algorithm meant to amp up engagement. This design means WhatsApp has little control over what content takes off and what doesnt; in most cases, the company cannot even see what is happening on WhatsApp because the service encrypts messages automatically.",recent month messaging app raised frightening new political social dynamic photo bloomberg real problem may much whatsapp company whatsapp product something fundamental  whatsapp idea world worry whatsapp become virulent new force global misinformation political trickery rather world rejoice whatsapp hasnt provided way people everywhere communicate securely encrypted message beyond reach government surveillance recent month messaging app owned facebook 15 billion user worldwide raised frightening new political social dynamic brazil bruising national election campaign whatsapp become primary vector conspiracy theory political misinformation whatsapp played similar role kenyas election last year india year false message child kidnapper went viral whatsapp leading mob violence killed dozen people whatsapp said working reduce spread misinformation service critic charge enough  merit claim yet deeper dig problem intractable come seem even company moving heaven earth fix unlike facebook twitter instagram whatsapp isnt social network mostly barebones texting app conversation private unmediated kind algorithm meant amp engagement design mean whatsapp little control content take doesnt case company even see happening whatsapp service encrypts message automatically,1

"Most cheaters try to manipulate games using DLL injection. A Dynamic Link Library (DLL) file contains code and data that can be simultaneously used by multiple programs.


Cheaters first access the system memory by placing a DLL file into the game process forcefully and then use the access to modify game related information. By modifying these codes, cheaters can gain unfair advantage by adding options like seeing opponents even when they are not in sight, or locking on a target in first attempt.


The company is using two third-party solutions, BattlEye and Uncheater, to protect the game process area. In addition to these, they are using machine learning models that first studies players usage patterns and then uses the markers to detect abnormal game patterns or actions.

"So what does look like a shower of sparks? Heres Hill again: When a helicopter descends into a sandy environment, the enormous downward thrust from the blades inevitably kicks up a cloud of sand. Cutting through the sand and dust, the blades smash into millions of these tiny particles, each sandblasting metal from the bladeEvery so often, the metal blasted from the blades produces a miniature meteor showerWhen a helicopters blades begin cutting through a cloud of sand, the particles hit the blades and send bits of metal flying into the air.""


Thats right: The halos are caused by tiny shards of pyrophoric metal, igniting spontaneously as they fly through the air. The same phenomenon, that is, thats at work in cigarette lighters and flintlock rifles and bits of metal that decrepit old cars drag behind them.


There in war-torn Afghanistan, Michael Yon captured a gorgeous visual treat that was, for him, simultaneously a reminder of the beauty in science and the despair of war. Yet while the pilots and soldiers around him were familiar with it, they had no name for it. On his blog, he asked: How can the helicopter halos, so majestic and indeed dangerous at times, be devoid of a fitting name?""


So he came up with his own name. At about the time he was photographing these silky helicopter halos, two young soldiers died in combat in Helmand: An American, Benjamin Kopp, and an Englishman, Joseph Etchells. For Yon, the halos were almost like a tribute to them and all the deaths in this war he had witnessed so closely. He writes: And so a fitting name had arrived to describe the halo glow we sometimes see in Helmand Province.""


The Kopp-Etchells Effect, then. A reminder that in the wrenching tragedy of war, sometimes you stumble on a touch of beauty.

Company employees in Washington knew the firms activities were a a problem,"" Rock said, calling it material information that should be disclosed to consumers.""


The incursions started in 2013, about 18 months before Facebook employees began discussing them in a string of email messages Racines office submitted with court papers, the companys lawyer said.


Facebook was not aware of the transfer of data from Kogan/GSR to Cambridge Analytica until December 2015, as we have testified under oath,"" a Facebook spokesperson said in an email to Bloomberg News on Friday, referring to the creator of the app that mined Facebook user data and shared it with Cambridge.

"Gait analysis is an expert opinion as per the Indian Evidence Act and admissible as evidence. The analysis in the Gauri Lankesh case was made by an expert from the Directorate of Forensic Science, Gujarat. DFS is certified u/s 79-A of IT Act as an Examiner of Electronic Evidence. In the eyes of law, they are treated as an expert,"" says DCP M.N. Anuchet, the chief investigating officer in the Gauri Lankesh murder case.


Beyond the realm of gait itself, law enforcement agencies are increasingly turning to technology during an investigation. While technologies like Mobile Signal Triangulation which can pinpoint a suspects location at the time of crime based on cellphone call records have begun to be deployed on a regular basis, newer tools like gait analysis, AI-backed face recognition, or machine learning tools to predict violent behaviour by a crowd are slowly gaining acceptance.


Delhi Police recently announced plans to use cutting-edge technology in investigations and has roped in the Indraprastha Institute of Technology Delhi (IIIT-D) for assistance. The institute has set up a Centre for Technology and Policing, which will help Delhi Police by providing them with the latest tools for interrogation, surveillance, and tracking along with research assistance in the field of biometrics, image processing, and forensic science,"" said Ranjan Bose, director, IIIT-D.


Advances in technology will also cut down the time spent on long-winded processes, which impedes investigative swiftness.


A case in point is the use of a Rapid DNA machine by the Bensalem police department in Philadelphia in the US. It can analyze DNA samples and give results in 90 minutes, unlike accredited labs which handle multiple forensic DNA analyses and take days to give results. These machines are as big as a desktop PC, which makes installing them easy, and can be operated by the police officials themselves. They use a cartridge, which costs $150, for every DNA analysis. Permitted by the US government, the machines will be installed in more police stations across the country. These machines can come in very handy in a country like India where the lack of DNA testing infrastructure and manpower has led to a serious backlog of unexamined DNA samples.


According to the Directorate of Forensic Science Services (DFSS) data, DNA samples from 12,072 sexual assault cases were waiting for examination in three of the six central forensic science laboratories which had the facility to test the samples, as on December 2017.


Machine learning is also being used now to assist in policing. Students at IIT Madras, for instance, have developed an AI-based crowd analysis tool which uses action recognition algorithms, crowd density maps, and analysis of live images captured by CCTV cameras to predict violent behaviour like stone pelting. The tool was showcased at Army Technology Seminar 2019 in Delhi by the IIT students.


Another AI-driven initiative in this area has come from a Gurgaon-based startup Staqu. The company has been working with several state police departments. One of their solutions, called Smart Glass, which is in pilot stage, uses facial recognition tools to auto-scan the faces and look up in a database for probable matches. The ability to faces via the Trinetra app has already come in handy to bust criminal gangs in UP. Staqus platform has not only helped us build a centralized database which includes the photos and history of all the criminals who are in and out of prison but has also made our operations much easier. Within seconds, we can verify if a person has a criminal record or not,"" says SK Bhagat, IG, Lucknow range. Staqus solutions have been used by Rajasthan, Punjab, Uttarakhand and the UP police to solve over 1,500 cases and build a database of more than 80,000 criminals.",gait analysis expert opinion per indian evidence act admissible evidence analysis gauri lankesh case made expert directorate forensic science gujarat dfs certified u 79a act examiner electronic evidence eye law treated expert say dcp mn anuchet chief investigating officer gauri lankesh murder case beyond realm gait law enforcement agency increasingly turning technology investigation technology like mobile signal triangulation pinpoint suspects location time crime based cellphone call record begun deployed regular basis newer tool like gait analysis aibacked face recognition machine learning tool predict violent behaviour crowd slowly gaining acceptance delhi police recently announced plan use cuttingedge technology investigation roped indraprastha institute technology delhi iiitd assistance institute set centre technology policing which help delhi police providing latest tool interrogation surveillance tracking along research assistance field biometrics image processing forensic science said ranjan bose director iiitd advance technology also cut time spent longwinded process impedes investigative swiftness case point use rapid dna machine bensalem police department philadelphia u analyze dna sample give result 90 minute unlike accredited lab handle multiple forensic dna analysis take day give result machine big desktop pc make installing easy operated police official use cartridge cost 150 every dna analysis permitted u government machine installed police station across country machine come handy country like india lack dna testing infrastructure manpower led serious backlog unexamined dna sample according directorate forensic science service dfss data dna sample 12072 sexual assault case waiting examination three six central forensic science laboratory facility test sample december 2017 machine learning also used assist policing student iit madras instance developed aibased crowd analysis tool us action recognition algorithm crowd density map analysis live image captured cctv camera predict violent behaviour like stone pelting tool showcased army technology seminar 2019 delhi iit student another aidriven initiative area come gurgaonbased startup staqu company working several state police department one solution called smart glass pilot stage us facial recognition tool autoscan face look database probable match ability face via trinetra app already come handy bust criminal gang staqus platform helped u build centralized database includes photo history criminal prison also made operation much easier within second verify person criminal record say sk bhagat ig lucknow range staqus solution used rajasthan punjab uttarakhand police solve 1500 case build database 80000 criminal,1

"For that matter, even the relaxation of tax on notional rent of unsold housing units held by the developer for 24 months (from the earlier 12 months) will give marginal relief. The share of ready-to-move, unsold residential units is a small portion of the total unsold inventory, say analysts at Crisil. This means that very few firms in the listed universe would gain from this tax relaxation. Besides, the earlier outgo on this front was not very high in any case.


The need of the hour is to propel demand for homes. Budgetary incentives such as raising personal income- tax exemption limit to ?5 lakh from ?2.5 lakh, higher standard deduction, higher taxable limit for rental income from homes and allowing capital gains proceeds to be reinvested in two homes instead of one (in a lifetime) may motivate homebuyers to own a second unit.


But tax incentives alone will not suffice. Demand revival in the sector will come from lower interest rates that would make monthly equated instalments more affordable. The trigger will ideally come from rate cuts by the central bank. Further, the tightness in liquidity due to the non-banking financial companies crisis is yet to ease. Meanwhile, property prices are still sticky in most parts of the country, which may also put buyers of a second home on the back foot.",matter even relaxation tax notional rent unsold housing unit held developer 24 month earlier 12 month give marginal relief share readytomove unsold residential unit small portion total unsold inventory say analyst crisil mean firm listed universe would gain tax relaxation besides earlier outgo front high case need hour propel demand home budgetary incentive raising personal income tax exemption limit 5 lakh 25 lakh higher standard deduction higher taxable limit rental income home allowing capital gain proceeds reinvested two home instead one lifetime may motivate homebuyers second unit tax incentive alone suffice demand revival sector come lower interest rate would make monthly equated instalment affordable trigger ideally come rate cut central bank tightness liquidity due nonbanking financial companies crisis yet ease meanwhile property price still sticky part country may also put buyer second home back foot,3

Conversing with assistants is routine for millions of people globally, whether on bedside alarm clocks, car audio systems or even high-end headphones. More than 1 billion such devices have Google Assistant, 100 million Amazon.com Inc's Alexa and at least 1 billion Apple Inc's Siri, according to the companies and estimates.


Regulators avoid stifling new technologies, said Richard Lawson, partner at Manatt, Phelps & Phillips and former consumer protection director in Florida's attorney generals office. But he said, authorities will still ask, ""How do you convey meaningful disclosures?""


At the conference, Schindler said ads on Google Assistant would be more ""interesting"" when responses are shown on a nearby screen, like a TV, smartphone, laptop or smart speaker with a display.


""Then we're exactly in the world that we deeply understand,"" Schindler said, with moneymaking options ""very similar"" to traditional search.

"In the gaming segment, Nvidia showcased its next generation RTX series graphics processing units (GPUs), while Acer showed its futuristic gaming chair. The former offers a higher number of CUDA cores, an additional RT (ray tracing) core for rendering detailed shadows and reflections for a more realistic visual experience, and a Tensor core which uses Artificial Intelligence to render visuals faster. CUDA is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) model, developed by Nvidia. Acer created quite a buzz with its Predator Thronos gaming chair, which stands 1.45m tall, has room for up to three 27-inch monitors and has space at the bottom to accommodate a desktop PC. The chair, which can be tilted backwards up to 140 degrees, is expected to cost upward of $5,000. Razers THX-enabled Kraken Tournament Edition headset is another gaming marvel. It is the first headset to support spatial audio technology, which delivers a 360-degree surround sound experience with realistic depth and pinpoint accuracy, allowing players to determine the exact direction from which the sound is coming. This can come in handy in multiplayer online games such as Fortnite and PlayerUnknowns Battlegrounds or PUBG. It will be available in the US at $100.

"Two years later, Reddy visited the University Pierre and Marie Curie (UPMC) in France for a period of six months as a Raman-Charpak Fellow where he explored How microwave propagates within human tissues. In the future, this study may help in Body Area Network (BAN) communication where doctors can seek information about patients medical condition without being physically present with the patient, Reddy said in a phone interview.


""It's the Internet of Things (IoT) where your body acts as a channel. Multiple sensors within your body communicate with a single sensor. My part was to generate an alogorithm to identify the modes of propagation within the body,"" Reddy explained.


BAN, also known as wireless body area network (WBAN) refers to the wireless network technology used in combination with wearables. The main purpose of these networks is to transmit data produced by wearable devices to a wireless local area netowrk (WLAN), to the Internet, or exchange the data directly with each other.


There are two types of devices in the global BAN market--wearable devices and implant devices. Of the two, the segment of wearable devices accounts for a greater share in the market, according to Transparency Market Research.


The market research firm estimates the global BAN market to touch about $63 million by 2025. Some of the key technologies leveraged in BAN include Bluetooth, ZigBee, Wi-Fi, and other communication technologies such as IEEE 802.15.6, mobile networks, Ultra Wideband (UWB), Zarlink technology, ANT protocol, Rubee active wireless protocol, Bluetooth Low Energy, according to the market research firm.",two year later reddy visited university pierre marie curie upmc france period six month ramancharpak fellow explored how microwave propagates within human tissues future study may help body area network ban communication doctor seek information patients medical condition without physically present patient reddy said phone interview internet thing iot body act channel multiple sensor within body communicate single sensor part generate alogorithm identify mode propagation within body reddy explained ban also known wireless body area network wban refers wireless network technology used combination wearable main purpose network transmit data produced wearable device wireless local area netowrk wlan internet exchange data directly two type device global ban marketwearable device implant device two segment wearable device account greater share market according transparency market research market research firm estimate global ban market touch 63 million 2025 key technology leveraged ban include bluetooth zigbee wifi communication technology ieee 802156 mobile network ultra wideband uwb zarlink technology ant protocol rubee active wireless protocol bluetooth low energy according market research firm,1

The third phase of Lok Sabha elections scheduled for Tuesday will see the maximum number of seats going to the polls in a single phase -- 117 across 15 states and Union Territories.


It will also be a test for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which will aim to defend the maximum number of seats at 62.


In the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP had won 62 of the 115 seats in the third phase, and its performance in this phase will be crucial in deciding its political fortunes.


The Congress had won 16 seats, while the remaining seats were divided between BJD (6), CPI-M (7), NCP (4), Samajwadi Party (3), Shiv Sena (2), RJD (2), AIUDF (2), IUML (2), LJP (1), PDP (1), RSP (1), Kerala Congress-M (1), CPI (1), Swabhimani Paksha (1) and Trinamool Congress (1).

"The AIADMK-BJP-PMK combine has to get a little more creative to mesh together symbols and ideologies and explain the alliance. In the lanes of Royapuram in Chennai Central constituency, Sam Pauls team was holding aloft mangoes, the PMK party symbol, though he held up his hand to form the instantly identifiable two leaves symbol of the AIADMK. The recorded message blaring from loudspeakers reminded people: Who gave you laptops? Amma. Who gave you cycles? Amma. Who made sure your children went to school? Amma. What was Ammas favourite fruit? Mambalam (mango). Vote for mango.""


Though BJP workers joined the procession, there was no mention of lotus or Prime Minister Narendra Modi. A day later, when BJP minister Smriti Irani visited the largely north Indian neighbourhood of Sowcarpet, the BJP flags and slogans appeared everywhere. Push the button for mango and a lotus will bloom in Delhi,"" she told the crowd.


Kannan Rajarathinam, who has authored biographies of both Anna and MGR, described Tamil Nadu as a unique state with leaders with a cult following beginning from Anna. It is inevitable that these leaders and their contributions are invoked. With time, and with voters becoming more discerning, this is likely to change,"" he said.


In comparison to the other parties in the fray, Kamal Haasans Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) candidates dont seem to lean so heavily on the star power of Kamal Haasan though he does turn out to drum up support for them. We are a party of educated and honest people,"" said Chennai South candidate R. Rangarajan, a former banker and IAS officer. Politics has no dearth of educated people, whats missing is honest people,"" he said. Our party will change that.""


Its a line that has found some traction with younger voters. Im tired of the nepotism in the DMK and the corruption of the AIADMK. The AIADMK seems to be the centres puppet after Jayalalithaa died,"" said Srivatsav Balan, 30, who works as a product manager in one of Chennais SaaS companies. Party manifestoes are still talking about the development of Tamil. I dont need that. I need water, roads, infrastructure, healthcare, cleaner air. I need to know that parties will resist the impositions of the centre on the south like NEET and GST,"" he added.


Kamal Haasan and Rajinikanth, if and when he chooses to contest, may find that star power is no longer enough on the Tamil Nadu electoral scene. Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan will have to deliver if they want us to keep voting for them. See what happened to Vijayakanth,"" said a 45-year-old auto driver, Rajan. He was referring to Vijayakanths Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam, which made its debut in the 2006 assembly polls and captured a 10% vote share. But the party has since petered out, and is now part of the AIADMK-BJP alliance.


Across the city, there is, of course, the oft-repeated refrain of exhaustion with the two main Dravidian parties. Im tired of having to choose between the AIADMK and the DMK,"" said Yesuraj, a cab driver. Im glad Kamal Haasan and T.T.V. are options even if they turn out to be no different over time.""",aiadmkbjppmk combine get little creative mesh together symbol ideology explain alliance lane royapuram chennai central constituency sam pauls team holding aloft mango pmk party symbol though held hand form instantly identifiable two leaf symbol aiadmk recorded message blaring loudspeaker reminded people who gave laptop amma gave cycle amma made sure child went school amma ammas favourite fruit mambalam mango vote mango though bjp worker joined procession mention lotus prime minister narendra modi day later bjp minister smriti irani visited largely north indian neighbourhood sowcarpet bjp flag slogan appeared everywhere push button mango lotus bloom delhi told crowd kannan rajarathinam authored biography anna mgr described tamil nadu unique state leader cult following beginning anna it inevitable leader contribution invoked time voter becoming discerning likely change said comparison party fray kamal haasans makkal needhi maiam mnm candidate dont seem lean heavily star power kamal haasan though turn drum support we party educated honest people said chennai south candidate r rangarajan former banker ia officer politics dearth educated people whats missing honest people said our party change its line found traction younger voter im tired nepotism dmk corruption aiadmk aiadmk seems centres puppet jayalalithaa died said srivatsav balan 30 work product manager one chennais saas company party manifesto still talking development tamil dont need need water road infrastructure healthcare cleaner air need know party resist imposition centre south like neet gst added kamal haasan rajinikanth chooses contest may find star power longer enough tamil nadu electoral scene rajinikanth kamal haasan deliver want u keep voting see happened vijayakanth said 45yearold auto driver rajan referring vijayakanths desiya murpokku dravida kazhagam made debut 2006 assembly poll captured 10 vote share party since petered part aiadmkbjp alliance across city course oftrepeated refrain exhaustion two main dravidian party im tired choose aiadmk dmk said yesuraj cab driver im glad kamal haasan ttv option even turn different time,0

"But with the scion of the Gandhi family choosing to contest from Kerala, rather than a place like Karnataka where the Congress is locked in a direct battle with the Bharatiya Janata Party, the equations have all toppled down. The local leaders are bristled. And they are not willing to go down in history without a pyrotechnic fight.


""This is a war and nobody should be a fence sitter. There is nothing impossible for us, we made a 50 lakh women's wall,"" said CPM boss in Kerala, Kodiyeri Balakrishnan in Malayalam, playing the local strongman image to the hilt, in an internal meet of party workers on Tuesday. A day before Gandhis expected arrival in Wayanad, both him and Kanam Rajendran were in the constituency, having several such meetings. Rajendran, the chief of Communist Party of India or CPI, the second biggest Left party in Kerala and whose candidate P.P. Suneer is Gandhis opponent.


Everybody in India will stand up and congratulate us if we defeat Rahul Gandhi... This is a golden chance to create history. He had so far contested only from places where they have not seen Communists like us. Now, he has come to us. I say get him. He has to leave this place saying: oh, the Communists are such a different party,"" Balakrishnan said.


According to Balakrishanans instructions, each of the volunteers, especially women, have to meet at least ten houses everyday for campaigning before the polls. This is apart from a more intensive squad of people who will visit 50 houses in four days. In a rather unusual thing, the front is also planning to carry out big celebrations on Vishu and Easter this month, important for Hindu and Christian communities in Kerala. Go and ask for votes on those days at your ancestral houses, even if you've not bothered to check on them until now,"" he said to a laughing audience of about hundred workers.",scion gandhi family choosing contest kerala rather place like karnataka congress locked direct battle bharatiya janata party equation toppled local leader bristled willing go history without pyrotechnic fight war nobody fence sitter nothing impossible u made 50 lakh womens wall said cpm bos kerala kodiyeri balakrishnan malayalam playing local strongman image hilt internal meet party worker tuesday day gandhis expected arrival wayanad kanam rajendran constituency several meeting rajendran chief communist party india cpi second biggest left party kerala whose candidate pp suneer gandhis opponent everybody india stand congratulate u defeat rahul gandhi golden chance create history far contested place seen communist like u come u say get leave place saying oh communist different party balakrishnan said according balakrishanans instruction volunteer especially woman meet least ten house everyday campaigning poll apart intensive squad people visit 50 house four day rather unusual thing front also planning carry big celebration vishu easter month important hindu christian community kerala go ask vote day ancestral house even youve bothered check said laughing audience hundred worker,0

"Vasudev has already worked with I Change My City (perhaps the oldest civic tech platform in the country which also serves as the technology back-end for the Swachh Bharat app), to submit citizen feedback to the Bangalore Development Authority and the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority. You can also access I Change My City independently to post grievances and issues through its Android and iOS apps or the web platform.


As Civis is a new platform, getting citizen feedback requires some legwork at the moment, but Vasudev hopes the platform alone will suffice in future, once the user base grows.


However, like all early-stage start-ups, these companies face challenges. A November 2017 report by the Knight Foundation highlighted funding, lack of success stories and growth paths as some of the hurdles. Netas Mittal, though, says he has already received interest from multiple big-name media firms who want to make equity investments in his app. Next Elections Bansal says that like any social platform, advertising is a viable option for him as well, alongside the rich data his platform will eventually generate. Civis, on the other hand, plans to depend on grants for sustaining itself in future. All three companies are bootstrapped (have invested their own money) at the moment.


Another good news is that investment firm Omidyar Network has partnered with venture capital company Village Capital to support civic tech start-ups. Other investments firms will likely follow suit.

"There are also concerns that the recent rally in the rupee may not sustain even if fears of a recession in the US dont come true. The appreciation in the local currency has been driven by higher foreign fund flows, but nothing material has changed on the ground in terms of fundamentals.

For now, currency traders have put these worries on the backburner. This rupee has strengthened from lows of about 71.81/$ in mid-February to 68.94/$ at present.


Rising expectations of a stable government have helped reverse sentiment and the US Federal Reserves recent dovish monetary policy stance also lent a hand. Consequently, foreign investors interest in Indian equities revived, aiding the rupees relief rally.

"Historically, a high voter turnout has usually benefited the main local opposition front in Kerala. Hence if the voters wanted to mark their anti-incumbency against the state-ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPM leader and chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan or the center-ruling Bharatiya Janata Party or BJP leader and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the high turnout would mean a surge in the votes for the main opposition Congress-led United Democratic Front or UDF.


However, this might vary from one constituency to another. In 12 out 20 seats, the voters are voting for or against a sitting Congress MP, hence if it is local incumbency that matters, it might favour the CPM.


In any case, political parties and analysts see the turnout as a reflection of strong fight between the three fronts, which became more high profile than usual this time.


The Congress had fielded their national president Rahul Gandhi in Wayanad and expected a favourable wave across the state, especially in North Kerala regions including Wayanad. The BJP wanted to expand its vote base banking on the Sabarimala agitations, and pitched a lot of effort to open its account for the first time in Kerala by fielding former state president and Mizoram Governor Kummanam Rajasekharan against heavyweight Congress politician Shashi Tharoor in Thiruvananthapuram. The CPM-led Left Democratic Front or LDF did not make it easier for any of the opposition, by fielding their strongest local faces, as many as six MLAs, in the fray.


The constituencies which received a high turnout are indicative. Wayanad for instance marked a record polling at 80.31%, probably a result of a minority consolidation behind Congress based on the candidature of Rahul Gandhi.",historically high voter turnout usually benefited main local opposition front kerala hence voter wanted mark antiincumbency stateruling communist party india marxist cpm leader chief minister pinarayi vijayan centerruling bharatiya janata party bjp leader prime minister narendra modi high turnout would mean surge vote main opposition congressled united democratic front udf however might vary one constituency another 12 20 seat voter voting sitting congress mp hence local incumbency matter might favour cpm case political party analyst see turnout reflection strong fight three front became high profile usual time congress fielded national president rahul gandhi wayanad expected favourable wave across state especially north kerala region including wayanad bjp wanted expand vote base banking sabarimala agitation pitched lot effort open account first time kerala fielding former state president mizoram governor kummanam rajasekharan heavyweight congress politician shashi tharoor thiruvananthapuram cpmled left democratic front ldf make easier opposition fielding strongest local face many six mlas fray constituency received high turnout indicative wayanad instance marked record polling 8031 probably result minority consolidation behind congress based candidature rahul gandhi,0

"The iPhone XS now comes with dual SIM functionality. However, it will sell in two variantsone for the Chinese market and one for the rest of the world. The iPhone XS for the Chinese markets will require two physical SIM cards, while the other variant will have one slot for a physical SIM card and one eSIM. eSIMs have been employed on the Apple Watch and they dont require a physical SIM card to be put inside the SIM tray for your phone number to function. It requires your network providers support to work, though. According to a presentation slide at the Apple event, Reliance Jio, Airtel and Vodafone were the Indian network providers that will support the eSIM functionality.


The iPhone XS builds on the edge-to-edge, notched OLED display of the iPhone X. Offered in 5.8-inch screen size, the iPhone XS sports a 2436x1125 resolution with a pixel density of 458ppithe highest on any Apple device. The displays support Dolby Vision and HDR10 and have iOS system-wide colour management that results in better colour accuracy.

"As far as the smartphone market is concerned, the top trends revolve around multiple cameras, nearly edge-less screens and more. Foldable phones bring forth a new form factor, and could theoretically solve one of the industrys biggest design problemshow to deliver big screens without making every phone the same brick-like device as the last.


That said, any new form factor isnt complete without software support. So, while companies like Samsung, Huawei and others may make initial changes to their software, the real use cases will come in when developers take interest. That, traditionally happens when products start attracting enough users, and that takes time. Similarly, Google will have to fundamentally change the Android operating system to take advantage of such screens as well.


It is likely that top smartphone brands will claim to have reinvented smartphone design because of foldable phones and screens. However, it will take longer for these foldable screens to reinvent the smartphone category and deliver differentiated experiences.

"An EUV mask, a sandwich of about 80 alternating layers of silicon and molybdenum, can fetch as much as $100,000. Only two companies  glassmakers Hoya Corp. and AGC Inc., both in Japan  manufacture the blanks. Lasertecs machines can spot problems early on, which is critical to making the technology cost competitive. For EUV, masks have to be perfect,"" Okabayashi said.


EUV lithography is so complex and expensive that so far only Samsung and TSMC have said they will use it to move to 7-nanometer chipmaking. Intel Corp. has delayed its introduction, while difficulties in making EUV economically viable have prompted Globalfoundries Inc. to reportedly abandon it altogether.


Samsung has said that the move lets it use chip area 40% more efficiently, improves performance by 20% and halves power consumption. Apples 7-nanometer processor is manufactured by TSMC and is specialized for machine-learning applications. In the past few months, Qualcomm Inc. and Huawei Technologies Co. unveiled a 7-nanometer chip that will power 5G devices.

"However, the production function for AI may not be too difficult to measure because the relevant machine learning algorithms and their performance at different times and with different data sets are usually well-documented, at least within the companies. Research is already on to determine the marginal effect of new data on predictions, though there are several conceptual and technical questions that still need to be worked out. This could be very useful for valuing data.


The funny thing is that Data as Labour could even help the tech titans in the long term, though in the short run, their profits will be squeezed. As AI grows more advanced, it will require more and better data.


Right now, through their surveillance, companies get mostly random data. As AI services get more sophisticated, algorithms will need to be fed a higher-quality diet of digital information, which people may only provide if they get paid.


In a recent book, Radical Markets: Uprooting Capitalism and Democracy For A Just Society, Glen Weyl, an economist at Yale University, and Eric Posner of the University of Chicago, write: Appropriate technological systems have to be developed for tracing and tracking the value created by individual users. These systems would have to balance a number of competing concerns.


On the one hand, they should try to measure which individual user is responsible for what data contributions, especially when these contributions are disproportionately large, and/or these individuals would be unlikely to supply or invest in this unique data that make these exceptional contributions unless they are monetarily incentivized. Creators of valuable entertainments, experts in obscure languages who can aid computer translators, specialized masters of video games who can help teach computers to play them expertly in multiplayer settings, these are unique skills worthy of exceptional rewards. On the other hand, tracking every detail of the ordinary use of a Facebook post would be overkill, and certain classes of data should be commoditized and paid an average price based on meeting basic quality standards.""


Maybe all this seems somewhat far-fetched. But the times we live in today, the things we do, what we see around us, would have seemed utterly incredible even 30 years ago. Google is only 20 years old and its already possibly the most powerful company on earth. Facebook was set up in 2004. Things can change very fast.

The tussle between Congress and regional parties is most visible in Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, where Akhilesh Yadav, Mayawati and Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee have shared the dais with Congress president Rahul Gandhi at recent meetings but have not agreed on seat-sharing arrangements.

"About 95% of the traffic Sophos tracked appeared to originate in China. This doesnt necessarily mean that the attackers conducting these brute-force attempts are also located in China, the report clarified, ""because attacks may be routed through other machines under the attackers' control"".


The London honeypot alone suffered 314,000 login attempts over the course of the 30 days in which Sophos ran these honeypots, while the honeypots hosted in Mumbai and Ireland received more than 600,000 login attempts. Does this mean that hosting services in London is safer than hosting services in Mumbai?


No, clarifies the Sophos report, since the brute-force login attempts varied in complexity from default usernames and passwords down to complex passwords with what security practitioners would consider sufficiently complex combinations of numbers, letters, and special characters. Looking at what drives this number of brute force login attempts, for instance, Sophos found the dominant problem was ongoing exposure as a result of not changing default usernames and passwords (eg. root, admin, user, ubuntu and postgres).


Further, many devices ship with default passwords. ""Whether they are easy to guess or not, this is always a mistake,"" cautions the Sophos report. The report advises that users should use complex and unique passwords for each service, and use a password manager too for simplicity.",95 traffic sophos tracked appeared originate china doesnt necessarily mean attacker conducting bruteforce attempt also located china report clarified attack may routed machine attacker control london honeypot alone suffered 314000 login attempt course 30 day sophos ran honeypot honeypot hosted mumbai ireland received 600000 login attempt mean hosting service london safer hosting service mumbai clarifies sophos report since bruteforce login attempt varied complexity default usernames password complex password security practitioner would consider sufficiently complex combination number letter special character looking drive number brute force login attempt instance sophos found dominant problem ongoing exposure result changing default usernames password eg root admin user ubuntu postgres many device ship default password whether easy guess always mistake caution sophos report report advises user use complex unique password service use password manager simplicity,1

"When the photos were shown to photographers, they were surprised as they and the subjects in the photos had no idea that those photos were being used for research. In its official statement to the press, IBM said that it used only images that were publicly available, had been used for an earlier research, and users can request them to be removed if they want.


The race to build the most reliable face recognition platform requires a massive data set of faces. Most existing data sets collected for prior research purposes are very limited and lack racial diversity to train facial recognition algorithms. Clearly, companies in the space will require more facial data. Experts are of the opinion that companies that are collecting and working on face data, need to be more transparent on how the data is stored, who all have access to it and how it is going to be used. While Facebooks photo privacy concern was pinned on an application programming interface (API) bug, the face recognition project by IBM was a case of oversight. However, in both cases, users had no control over their own photos.


There are several cases where photos shared by users on social media or image hosting platforms were stolen, made public to humiliate or blackmail them and misused for fraud and identity theft. Photos from social media can also be used to unlock stolen smartphones where face unlocking mechanism was poorly implemented. Sometimes, photos can reveal more than is visible to users, like location details.


According to researchers from department of Computer Science in Kent State University, when a user shares a photo on social media, the platform captures their GPS coordinates and appends them to the post. Using the API, anyone can retrieve the exact location of the picture via the metadata, while anyone seeing the post could get the location of the user via geospatial tag in the post.

Googles possible return to China - a market it abandoned over censorship concerns in 2010 - was first leaked in August by The Intercept which reported that the US tech giant was secretly developing Dragonfly"", a custom-made search engine for the huge Chinese market.",googles possible return chinaa market abandoned censorship concern 2010was first leaked august photo reuters ceo sundar pichai say google absence chinaa country 20 world populationweighed heavily company mission bring information everyone new york google still considering whether launch censored version search engine china ceo sundar pichai said rare public comment controversial secret project googles possible return china market abandoned censorship concern 2010 first leaked august intercept reported u tech giant secretly developing dragonfly custommade search engine huge chinese market,1

Though several speak of the nation"", muscular nationalism and surgical strikes are not on the radar, even among Modi backers.


To find remnants of nationalism, one has to travel deep inland to the town of Pokhran in the neighbouring Jodhpur constituency. Though the seat is faced with the states most high-profile contestbetween Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, a future BJP chief ministerial prospect, and Vaibhav Gehlot, the son of the sitting Congress chief minister, many young Hindu men and self-declared Modi fans"" will only talk about two people who are not in the fray: Modi, obviously, and Saleh Mohammed, the local assembly representative.


In the December assembly election, Mohammed defeated BJPs Pratap Puri, a Hindu sant, by a thin margin of 900 votes. The assembly seat is 30% Muslim, but in a Hindu-dominated town surrounded by a cluster of Muslim-dominated villages, anxiety runs deep.

"Jayalalithaas death in 2016 and Karunanidhis two years later have introduced a sense of uncertainty in Tamil politics.

Now, the party has to win 20 of the 22 assembly seats in the byelections to be contested on Thursday and in Mayjust to stay in power, amid anti-incumbency, splinter groups, splitting votes and a general resentment of its tie-up with the Bharatiya Janata Party.

"Another factor which makes existing global data sets stale is the standard methodology they use. For example, in the Stereographic imagery method, a satellite with two cameras placed at a specified angle is used to take two images of each location at the same time. Looking at the differences between those images helps calculate the height of the elevation at every point. Google is taking a slightly different"" approach. Instead of using expensive specialized satellite missions, Google first purchased large amounts of standard high resolution optical imagery that is captured anyway, from different sources, and then used them to generate high-resolution elevation.


Google also collaborated with governments for gauge measurements and forecasts so they could tell how much water can be poured into the models and how much can be expected to flow through them. Further, Google wanted a map that ignores anything that water can flow through or under and retain things that would block the waters progression. To do this, they used a convolutional neural network (loosely modelled on the brain) that automatically identifies one location or structures that has to be ignored. It can then remove these structures and give an elevation map that the model needs, Nevo said.",another factor make existing global data set stale standard methodology use example stereographic imagery method satellite two camera placed specified angle used take two image location time looking difference image help calculate height elevation every point google taking slightly different approach instead using expensive specialized satellite mission google first purchased large amount standard high resolution optical imagery captured anyway different source used generate highresolution elevation google also collaborated government gauge measurement forecast could tell much water poured model much expected flow google wanted map ignores anything water flow retain thing would block waters progression used convolutional neural network loosely modelled brain automatically identifies one location structure ignored remove structure give elevation map model need nevo said,1

"Chinese smartphone Vivo launched the Vivo V15 smartphone in Thailand on Monday. The Vivo V15 is priced at 10,999 Thai Baht (about ?24,500). The Vivo V15 is essentially a stripped down variant of the V15 Pro, which went on sale yesterday in India at ?28,990.


The Vivo V15 sports the same pop-up camera mechanism, display and design as the V15 Pro but lacks a few key features. The V15 skips the 48MP primary rear camera and goes for the traditional rear-facing fingerprint sensor instead of an in-display sensor found inside the V15 Pro. The V15 runs MediaTek's Helio P70 processor while the V15 Pro runs Qualcomm's Snapdragon 675 SoC.


The Vivo V15 and V15 Pro offer the same designa notch-less display at the front, a glossy back with dual tone gradient in the same colours.

"Glackin insists that monsoon forecasts are important for Indian agriculture, especially as climate changes because farmers no longer can rely on just traditional knowledge.


But what exactly is this Decision Platform? Data is the first part of the platform, explains Glackin. It comprises weather data collected from remote sensing and satellite imagery and drones that are being used in some parts of the world.


The second big part is collating localized weather data, which could also be historical. This data helps IBM build an electronic field record to understand the historical context and current scenario. If you are a lender, you may want to know the past record in that field or plotrisk of the particular farmerwhat was grown there, for instance,"" explains Glackin. The third part is extracting insights from that data, which is where machine learning and AI are used.

"HYDERABAD: Hyderabad: In just about a years time, the political landscape of Andhra Pradesh has changed completely, with the narrative now revolving around the demand of special category status for the state. The alliances between parties are also in complete reversal, with the ruling Telugu Desam Party (TDP) now facing a serious threat from the main opposition YSR Congress Party (YSRCP), and finding itself without an alliance partner before the forthcoming assembly and Lok Sabha elections.


In 2014, the TDP, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and actor-turned-politician Pawan Kalyans Jana Sena party (JSP) had joined hands to take on the Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy-led YSRCP. This time, the electoral battle is likely to be a multi-cornered fight, with the TDP exiting the NDA in March last year, over alleged lack of enough central funding and demand for special status, and Kalyan withdrawing support to the TDP in 2018.


The JSP leader even surprised everyone by lashing out against TDP supremo and Andhra Pradesh chief minister N. Chandrababu Naidu and his son and IT minister N. Lokesh, alleging that they were corrupt. Earlier this year, Kalyan had announced that he will contest the polls in alliance with Left parties.

"Moreover, distributors are beginning to consider other brands as options too, though none of those who spoke with Mint mentioned Indian brands, specifically, as being under their consideration.


But the unintended side-effect of the disruption unleashed by Jio, which caused the temporary downfall of the feature phone, has been the massive expansion in the market itself. Many of the first-time mobile internet users may get on board via the feature phonethe erstwhile forte of the likes of Micromax and Lava.


Feature phone is also a segment where Indian brands never really lost their presence completely. In fact, in December 2017, Micromax claimed it had sold three million handsets under its Bharat range of cheap smartphones.


The launch of the Jiophone2 and Airtels nascent plans to launch its own low-cost device means telcos may be on the look-out for a number of tie-ups with phone makers.


Micromaxs Jain dreams of a future where the ideal smartphone strategy is not just new product launches, but tying up with telcos, so that consumers buy a phone and get 4G plans bundled with it.


Theres a general belief in Tier III and Tier IV towns that if youre using a smartphone, your data gets consumed automatically,"" said Jain. He thinks this is why the Jiophone was a subsidised feature phone, instead of a subsidised smartphone. Slowly and steadily, consumers started consuming data... And even 1GB becomes too less for an entire month,"" he added.


IDCs Navkendar Singh agrees that Micromax and Lava still have juice left"", though he also mentioned that Intex has almost moved out"" of the market. Theyll have to pick and choose their battles. Dont fight Xiaomi in the ? 7,000- ? 10,000 range,"" said Singh. He suggested that the right government and telco tie-ups could help.


Micromax recently won a ? 15,00-crore deal from the Chattisgarh government to distribute 50 lakh smartphones part of an emerging trend in politics where free phones are dangled to win over youth support.


But merely relying on such populist sops, or possible tie-ups with telcos, isnt much of a strategy. Unless Indian phone makers can quickly figure out a way to go down the relatively cheap premium route""a segment OnePlus completely dominates their hopes of a dramatic return to the dominance of 2014 may be dangling by a very tenuous thread.

"Even as advancements in technology such as brain-computer interfaces and sensor-lined caps with neural interface software could soon be used by brain researchers to control computers, robotic prosthetic limbs, motorized wheelchairs and even digital avatars, cyberattackers may be able to exploit memory implants to steal, spy on, alter or control human memories. And while the most radical threats are several decades away, the essential technology already exists in the form of implantable deep brain stimulation devices, according to a 1 November report by researchers from Kaspersky Lab and the University of Oxford Functional Neurosurgery Group.


As scientists learn how memories are created in the brain and can be targeted, restored and enhanced using such implantable devices, they simultaneously caution that vulnerabilities exist in the connected software and hardware and these need to be addressed if we are to be ready for the threats that lie ahead"".


Known as implantable pulse generators or neurostimulators, these contraptions send electrical impulses to specific targets in the brain to treat disorders such as Parkinsons disease, essential tremor, major depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder.


The latest generation of these implants comes with management software for both clinicians and patients.

"A part of the increase was also due to the Election Commission's efforts at cleaning up voter rolls to eliminate non-existent voters, but widespread voter anger also helped. The post-Emergency 1977 elections had also witnessed a huge turnout.

"In fact, the survey more specifically points out: In the first place, there has been no statistical evidence of any increase in economic bads"" such as consumption of alcohol and tobacco. On the contrary, in Bhil tribal village, there was actually a drop in consumption of alcohol since that is where people had liquidity to use for agricultural inputs and therefore one saw an increase in agricultural productivity and own cultivation effect.""


Interestingly, evidence from Africa, is also along similar lines. As Rutger Bregman writes in Utopia for Realists: The great thing about money is that people can use it to buy things they need instead of things that self-appointed experts think they need. And, as it happens, there is one category of product which poor people do not spend their free money on, and thats alcohol and tobacco. In fact, a major study by the World Bank demonstrated that in 82% of all researched cases in Africa, Latin America, and Asia, alcohol and tobacco consumption actually declined.""


The Congress plans to tackle this problem by making the payment to women. In fact, former finance minister P. Chidambaram has said: We will insist that every family should open an account in the name of the woman in the family and the money will be transferred to her account.""


The logic here is that free money from the government will make people lazy and this will lead to them dropping out of the labour force. Lets look at this in the context of NYAY. An amount of ?6,000 per month per household has been promised. An average Indian household has five individuals. So, this works out to ?1,200 per month per individual, on an average. People who feel that individuals will opt out of the workforce because the unit members are earning ?1,200 per month extra, have a very low opinion of the ambitions of Indians. Also, if they stop working, their situation may continue to be the same as it was earlier, and the entire benefit of the extra money will be nullified. This concern largely comes from the wrong belief of the rich and the middle class that the poor are poor because they are lazy.


There is evidence from different parts of the world which doesnt suggest anything like this. As an August 2018 research paper titled Universal Basic Income: An Effective Policy for Poverty Reduction? published by the Centre for Social Justice, points out: The extent to which UBI disincentives work is dependent on its generosity. The Alaska Permanent Fund pays out $2,000 annually, and analysis has shown that it has little to no effect on the supply of labour."" By that logic ?1,200 per individual per month is not high at all.


In fact, the Canadian Mincome experiment carried out in the 1970s, had some very interesting evidence to offer on this front. As Standing points out: In the Canadian Mincome experiment, mothers with newborns stopped working because they wanted to stay at home longer with their babies, and teenagers worked less because they werent under much pressure to support their families, which resulted in more teenagers graduating."" This is the kind of withdrawal from the labour force, which is good in the long term.


In fact, this is the most genuine concern. NYAY is expected to cost ?3.6 trillion or around 1.7% of the forecasted gross domestic product (GDP) for 2019-20. As Chidambaram has said: Our calculation shows that it will not cross 2% of the GDP, it will be 1.8% of the GDP at any given point of time.""

"How reliable are foldable screens? Most of these foldable phones have more plastic substrates, which is what makes them bendable. Technically, plastic substrates are less prone to damage than glass, but can bend up to only a certain point. Royole Corp. claims that the organic light-emitting diode panel used in FlexPai has been tested to withstand bending over 200,000 times. Chinese display maker BOE  has developed a 7.56-inch foldable display that can bend more than 100,000 times. Experts feel bendable screens will have shorter life cycle than existing phones. While technological advances, such as the polymer of the flexible displays are more durable, it would eventually wear out from a lot of folding and unfolding. This, in turn, could lead to a natural replacement cycle, cutting shorter the long upgrade cycles that the market is witnessing currently,"" explains Prabhu Ram, head (Industry Intelligence Group) at CyberMedia Research. 


How soon will we see them?: While FlexPai will start shipping from next month, Samsung is expected to roll out its foldable smartphone sometime during the first half of 2019 and ship at least one million units. Like most new technologies, foldable screens will be available at a premium. Display is a major component in a smartphone, which accounts for 20-30% of the Bill of Materials cost in a premium smartphone. Therefore, higher display prices will directly affect the cost of the smartphone. The initial adoption will be limited to few models in the premium smartphone segment in 2019 and price diffusion to lower price tier will take substantially more time than any of the other recent new features,"" says Pavel Naiya, senior analyst (Devices and Ecosystem) at research firm Counterpoint.


Challenges:  The technology is still in its early stages. Manufacturers will have to tweak their interface, developers will have to customize their apps for the new form factor and aspect ratio, and display makers will have to find ways to enhance the life of the panel. Existing displays will not die away as there will always be buyers looking for a smaller screen. Smartphones with large foldable screens will be relevant for users looking for that extra bit of legroom for work and fun.",reliable foldable screen foldable phone plastic substrate make bendable technically plastic substrate less prone damage glass bend certain point royole corp claim organic lightemitting diode panel used flexpai tested withstand bending 200000 time chinese display maker boe developed 756inch foldable display bend 100000 time expert feel bendable screen shorter life cycle existing phone while technological advance polymer flexible display durable would eventually wear lot folding unfolding turn could lead natural replacement cycle cutting shorter long upgrade cycle market witnessing currently explains prabhu ram head industry intelligence group cybermedia research soon see flexpai start shipping next month samsung expected roll foldable smartphone sometime first half 2019 ship least one million unit like new technology foldable screen available premium display major component smartphone account 2030 bill material cost premium smartphone therefore higher display price directly affect cost smartphone initial adoption limited model premium smartphone segment 2019 price diffusion lower price tier take substantially time recent new feature say pavel naiya senior analyst device ecosystem research firm counterpoint challenge technology still early stage manufacturer tweak interface developer customize apps new form factor aspect ratio display maker find way enhance life panel existing display die away always buyer looking smaller screen smartphones large foldable screen relevant user looking extra bit legroom work fun,1

"On one end there is Mumbai, Indias densest city with 19,652 people per sq. km (20,980 in suburban Mumbai as per the 2011 census) and on the other, there is Nandurbar, 360km away, with a population density of 277. Nearly 70% of Nandurbars population is tribal, making it the third district in the state with the highest share of scheduled tribes (ST).


Maharashtras Economic Survey 2017-18 says that in 2016-17, Mumbai added a gross value of ?3.85 trillion at current prices. Meanwhile, Nandurbar and the neighbouring district of Dhule generated gross value of only ?13,580 crore and ?24,885 crore, respectively. Mumbais Human Development Index (2011 census) was 0.841, the highest in the state, and Nandurbar with 0.604 HDI is at the bottom of the pile. Even Nashik, which goes to polls on 29 April, has HDI of 0.746, which is in the highest category.

"It is likely that the BJP may integrate both the jai jawan"" and jai kisaan"" themes in its communications to the votersunderscoring the recent largesse to the farmers in the 1 February interim budget, as well as celebrating the soldier after the recent Balakot air strike. National security and his ability to be a decisive leader is surely a strong theme after Uri, Pulwama and Balakot. The farmer theme though is not as strongduring his regime, a lot may have been done, but on-ground, the feedback is not all positive.""


Goyal said nationalism could be a big poll theme this year and Uri, the movie, had set the tone. The happenings at Pulwama and the retaliation at Balakot will surely be a big part of the Modi narrative in the elections. Nationalism is a big stroke. National pride is an even bigger stimulus.""


Unfortunately, nationalism in the garb of patriotism has become mainstream over the past five years, said advertising expert Sanjay Sarma, founder of SSarma Consults, a boutique branding and communications advisory. Thats been one of the biggest achievements of this government. Since it has worked for them, I would imagine it to be the fabric that would hold their entire campaign together.

"An EUV mask, a sandwich of about 80 alternating layers of silicon and molybdenum, can fetch as much as $100,000. Only two companies  glassmakers Hoya Corp. and AGC Inc., both in Japan  manufacture the blanks. Lasertecs machines can spot problems early on, which is critical to making the technology cost competitive. For EUV, masks have to be perfect,"" Okabayashi said.


EUV lithography is so complex and expensive that so far only Samsung and TSMC have said they will use it to move to 7-nanometer chipmaking. Intel Corp. has delayed its introduction, while difficulties in making EUV economically viable have prompted Globalfoundries Inc. to reportedly abandon it altogether.


Samsung has said that the move lets it use chip area 40 percent more efficiently, improves performance by 20 percent and halves power consumption. Apples 7-nanometer processor is manufactured by TSMC and is specialized for machine-learning applications. In the past few months, Qualcomm Inc. and Huawei Technologies Co. unveiled a 7-nanometer chip that will power 5G devices.

"New users: For users planning to buy a new Kindle, the choice is between an entry-level All-New Kindle, the All-New Kindle Paperwhite and the top-of-the-line Kindle Oasis. All the models use a touch-enabled e-ink display with thin glass on top. Unlike LCD displays, which require consistent power supply to show content on screen, e-ink displays need power only when a user has to flip pages. That makes them battery efficient, allowing Kindles to last several days (around 2 weeks) on each charge.


However, size of the e-ink displays varies based on models, as do their resolution. For instance, the most affordable the All-New Kindle ( ? 5,999)has a 6-inch e-ink display, which relies entirely on ambient light to show text on the screen. So, you cant use it in a dark room. However, a small, low-wattage light bulb is all you need to use the entry-level Kindle effectively. You can even use a book light, which can be clipped on top of the Kindle and costs under ? 1,000. Moreover, the absence of a backlight means there will be no strain on your eyes when reading, making the entry-level Kindle the digital equivalent of a real book. It offers 4GB of internal storage, which is enough to house over 1,000 books.",new user user planning buy new kindle choice entrylevel allnew kindle allnew kindle paperwhite topoftheline kindle oasis model use touchenabled eink display thin glass top unlike lcd display require consistent power supply show content screen eink display need power user flip page make battery efficient allowing kindles last several day around 2 week charge however size eink display varies based model resolution instance affordable the allnew kindle 5999has 6inch eink display relies entirely ambient light show text screen cant use dark room however small lowwattage light bulb need use entrylevel kindle effectively even use book light clipped top kindle cost 1000 moreover absence backlight mean strain eye reading making entrylevel kindle digital equivalent real book offer 4gb internal storage enough house 1000 book,1

Despite predictions that cloud-based gaming would make hardware obsolete, Sony Playstation enjoys one of the strongest product cycles seen in the business


Five years after its debut, Sony Corp.s $300 console is enjoying one of the strongest product cycles seen in the business, thanks to a steady stream of popular game titles. Thats helped the Tokyo-based company ship twice as many PS4s as Microsoft Corp.s Xbox One, even without relying on its usual tempo of price cuts.


That puts Sonys franchise in a strong position to counter the $34.6 billion console industrys next challenge: games delivered via the web.

"Others joining the parade of pain include Samsung Electronics Co. and LG Electronics Inc. Both South Korean companies posted declines in operating profit last quarter and missed estimates. Samsung makes more than smartphones, but even its other divisions  chips and displays  depend heavily on that product category.


Its important to note that those three companies are the largest non-Chinese names, and get only a minority of revenue from China. So if theyre hurting, then the whole world is probably hurting, too.


If theres a silver lining to the recent slowdown in shipments its that the higher functionality requires more expensive components, which boosted gross margins at some suppliers. But margins only help when people are still buying those cooler, hipper, more-expensive devices.


That silver lining is also likely to darken this year because smartphone makers seem to be running out of of ideas. Instead theyre likely to resort to gimmicks like folding handsets and horrifically ugly 3D cameras, in an attempt to spur excitement.

"The Wipro workers said they gain a window into lives as they view a vacation photo or a post memorializing a deceased family member. Facebook acknowledged that some posts, including screenshots and those with comments, may include user names.


The company said its legal and privacy teams must sign off on all labeling efforts, adding that it recently introduced an auditing system ""to ensure that privacy expectations are being followed and parameters in place are working as expected.""


But one former Facebook privacy manager, speaking on condition of anonymity, expressed unease about users' posts being scrutinized without their explicit permission. The European Union's year-old General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has strict rules about how companies gather and use personal data and in many cases requires specific consent.


""One of the key pieces of GDPR is purpose limitation,"" said John Kennedy, a partner at law firm Wiggin and Dana who has worked on outsourcing, privacy and AI.


If the purpose is looking at posts to improve the precision of services, that should be stated explicitly, Kennedy said. Using an outside vendor for the work could also require consent, he said.

New Delhi: This year, we saw some technologies mature while others became better understood. What was once a buzzword is now close to mainstream. And what was once a dream, is now closer to reality. We highlight 10 technologies, which we at Mint believe, will make a significant impact in 2019.


AI is creeping into almost every aspect of our lives. Its in our smartphones, our cars, our email inboxes and in our smart homes. From companies implementing AI-powered human resource (HR) technologies to AI managing logistics and operations, and even helping click better photos on your phone, AI is everywherein the form of machine learning (ML), deep learning (an ML technique), computer vision or natural language processing (NLP). AI will accompany every other disruptive tech we speak of such as detecting facial and human emotions, and recognising people from their gaits. It will also be used to predict how humans will react to ads, movie trailers and more.


Blockchain is not just about powering cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether. A distributed digital ledger format, it is also being used by manufacturing companies to improve their supply chains; by healthcare and electricity companies; and by the financial sector to make transactions more transparent.


For instance, NITI Aayog and Oracle plan to start a drug supply-chain blockchain ledger, which is meant to help fight counterfeit drugs in the country. The Telangana State Information Technology, Electronics and Communication department has tied up with IT services provider Tech Mahindra to launch Indias first Blockchain district in Telangana. However, most pilots are being done with private (permissioned) blockchains that can perform thousands of transactions per second. In India, for instance, banks have formed BankChainan alliance of banks formed in February 2017 to explore and build blockchain-based solutions.",prediction 2019 report forrester predicts 40 enterprise digital worker next year mintindiawire groundbreaking technologiesartificial intelligenceblockchain technologyinternet thingsvirtual reality3d printingroboticsrobotic process automation5gedge computingquantum computingtechnologies new delhi year saw technology mature others became better understood buzzword close mainstream dream closer reality highlight 10 technology mint believe make significant impact 2019 ai creeping almost every aspect life its smartphones car email inboxes smart home company implementing aipowered human resource hr technology ai managing logistics operation even helping click better photo phone ai everywherein form machine learning ml deep learning ml technique computer vision natural language processing nlp ai accompany every disruptive tech speak detecting facial human emotion recognising people gait also used predict human react ad movie trailer blockchain powering cryptocurrencies like bitcoin ether distributed digital ledger format also used manufacturing company improve supply chain healthcare electricity company financial sector make transaction transparent instance niti aayog oracle plan start drug supplychain blockchain ledger meant help fight counterfeit drug country telangana state information technology electronics communication department tied service provider tech mahindra launch indias first blockchain district telangana however pilot done private permissioned blockchains perform thousand transaction per second india instance bank formed bankchainan alliance bank formed february 2017 explore build blockchainbased solution,1

"Ram Prasad Yadav (left) and Hanuman Prasad Yadav are small farmers from Barabanki, Uttar Pradesh. They strongly feel that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will return to power as he saved cows from slaughter and the country from terrorism. (Sayantan Bera/Mint)


Farmers in central Uttar Pradesh appear happy with the PM-Kisan scheme and are singing a nationalist tune


Lucknow/Amethi/Agra: The face of Sri Ram, a marginal farmer who doubles up as a village barber, sinks as he shows his bank passbook. The Sunday when Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a direct cash transfer scheme for farmers in Uttar Pradeshs Gorakhpur, about two weeks before the dates of general elections were announced on 10 March, Sri Rams account was credited with ?2,000, a sizeable sum for someone who struggles to make ?50 on an average day.


The credit was reversed the same day, Ram found out later from the bank but he wasnt told why. The disappointment on Rams face shows that small sums of money do make a difference when incomes fluctuate from one day to the next. Under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme (PM-KISAN) announced in the interim budget in February, small and marginal farm households owning less than five acres of land are eligible for a direct cash assistance of ?6,000 every year, credited to bank accounts in three instalments.


For a farmer struggling to make ends meet any support is better than nothing, but the timing of the scheme which was launched just before the elections revealed the governments true intentions,"" said Rakesh Singh, also a farmer, standing next to Ram. PM-KISAN is similar to how politicians bribe voters on the eve of elections, complained Singh, adding, the handout will not even cover the irrigation costs for growing an acre of wheat crop.


This discussion is taking place on the sidelines of a public hearing organized by a social worker in Jais-Bahadurpur in Uttar Pradeshs Amethi. Among the motley crowd are a group of scheduled caste women who are yet to receive the money. They too are disappointed but are more worried that their names are missing from the subsidized food distribution scheme.


Some distance away from the public hearing, residents of Amethis Pure Dhana Pandey village, who are mostly farmers and daily wagers, defended Prime Minister Narendra Modis new scheme for farmers, after a host of other schemes, from soil health card to crop insurance, failed to make a mark. Cash deposits are better than spending money on schemes we have to bribe local officials to benefit from government schemes. Even bank officials take commissions for advancing (subsidized) farm loans,"" said Rajesh Kumar, a potato grower.",ram prasad yadav left hanuman prasad yadav small farmer barabanki uttar pradesh strongly feel prime minister narendra modi return power saved cow slaughter country terrorism sayantan beramint farmer central uttar pradesh appear happy pmkisan scheme singing nationalist tune lucknowamethiagra face sri ram marginal farmer double village barber sink show bank passbook sunday prime minister narendra modi launched direct cash transfer scheme farmer uttar pradeshs gorakhpur two week date general election announced 10 march sri rams account credited 2000 sizeable sum someone struggle make 50 average day credit reversed day ram found later bank wasnt told disappointment rams face show small sum money make difference income fluctuate one day next pradhan mantri kisan samman nidhi scheme pmkisan announced interim budget february small marginal farm household owning less five acre land eligible direct cash assistance 6000 every year credited bank account three instalment for farmer struggling make end meet support better nothing timing scheme launched election revealed governments true intention said rakesh singh also farmer standing next ram pmkisan similar politician bribe voter eve election complained singh adding handout even cover irrigation cost growing acre wheat crop discussion taking place sideline public hearing organized social worker jaisbahadurpur uttar pradeshs amethi among motley crowd group scheduled caste woman yet receive money disappointed worried name missing subsidized food distribution scheme distance away public hearing resident amethis pure dhana pandey village mostly farmer daily wager defended prime minister narendra modis new scheme farmer host scheme soil health card crop insurance failed make mark cash deposit better spending money scheme bribe local official benefit government scheme even bank official take commission advancing subsidized farm loan said rajesh kumar potato grower,0

"The English-language Bible comes in many different written styles, making it the perfect source text to work with for style translation,"" said Keith Carlson, a PhD student at Dartmouth and lead author of the research paper.


An added benefit for the research team is that the Bible is already thoroughly indexed by the consistent use of book, chapter and verse numbers. The predictable organization of the text across versions eliminates the risk of errors that could be caused by automatic methods of matching different versions of the same text.


The Bible is a divine data set to work with to study this task,"" said Daniel Rockmore, a professor of computer science at Dartmouth and a contributing author on the study. Humans have been performing the task of organizing Bible texts for centuries, so we didnt have to put our faith into less reliable alignment algorithms.""",the englishlanguage bible come many different written style making perfect source text work style translation said keith carlson phd student dartmouth lead author research paper added benefit research team bible already thoroughly indexed consistent use book chapter verse number predictable organization text across version eliminates risk error could caused automatic method matching different version text the bible divine data set work study task said daniel rockmore professor computer science dartmouth contributing author study humans performing task organizing bible text century didnt put faith less reliable alignment algorithm,1

"Its only a matter of time until the bearish bet pays off big, according to Crescat Capital LLC. While the Denver-based firm has only about $50 million under management, it has a history of outperforming the S&P 500 Indexwith its Global Macro Fund returning 41% last year alone. Now the investment company says its ready to capitalize on an end of the economic cycle as indicators warn that a recession is imminent in the coming quarters.


The consensus is pointing to a recession in 2020 or 2021, Tavi Costa, a global macro analyst at Crescat, said by phone. We think its a lot closer than that and we have a number of macro timing indicators that we look at.""


Going long gold in yuan terms and shorting global equities currently explains three-quarters of the hedge funds strategy. While the firm uses the MSCI World Index in models to visualize the trade, it goes a bit deeper with its short position, selecting individual stocks and exchange-traded funds to bet against.


Among the warning signs, Crescat cites corporate insiders who are currently selling stocks hand over fistindicating a potential stock bubble burst. In early 2017, those investors heavily sold shares while the S&P 500 continued climbing. That happened again in 2018.

"ByteDances content platforms enable people to enjoy content powered by AI technology,"" its website says. Its vision is to build global creation and interaction platforms."" ByteDances wildly popular news and entertainment portal, Jinri Toutiao (translated as Todays Headlines,"") relies heavily on AI  not human editors, or a self-selected feed of accounts  to curate and create customized streams of largely user-and-partner-generated content tailored to each of its readers.


These are services where a sort of filter"" bubble  isolating users into worlds of points of view  isnt an unintended consequence. Its the point. And its extremely effective: Both Toutiao and Douyin have drawn attention from Chinese regulators for, among many other things, some familiar to any large social-ish platform, and others unique to its speech-constrained political environment, capturing too much user time. As a result, TikToks Digital Wellbeing"" settings include an option to enforce a password-protected time limit. The companys other challenges can be addressed more assertively: an algorithm-first attention market isnt just centrally ruled, its centrally allocated.


All of this goes a long way to explain why, at least at first, TikTok can seem disorienting. Youre not actually sure why youre seeing what youre seeing,"" said Ankur Thakkar, the former editorial lead at Vine, TikToks other most direct forerunner. On Vine, a new user might not have had much to watch, or felt much of a reason to create anything, but they understood their context: the list of people they followed, which was probably the thing letting them down.


Its doing the thing that Twitter tried to solve, that everyone tried to solve,"" he said. How do you get people to engage?"" Apparently you just ... show them things, and let a powerful artificial intelligence take notes. You start sending daily notifications immediately. You tell them what to do. You fake it till you make it, algorithmically speaking.


U.S. social platforms, each fighting their own desperate and often stock-price-related fights to increase user engagement, have trended in TikToks general direction for a while. It is possible, today, to receive highly personalized and effectively infinite content recommendations in YouTube without ever following a single account, because Google watches what you do, and makes guesses about who you are. And while Facebook and Twitter dont talk about their products this way, we understand that sometimes  maybe a lot of the time  we use them just to fill time. They, in turn, want as much of our time as possible, and are quite obviously doing whatever they can to get it.


So maybe youll sit TikTok out. But these things have a way of sneaking up behind you. Maybe you never joined Snapchat  but its rise worried Facebook so much that its prettier product, Instagram, was remade in its image, and copied concepts from Snapchat reached you there.


And maybe you skipped Twitter  but it still rewired your entire news diet, and, besides, its how the president talks to you, now.


TikTok does away with many of the assumptions other social platforms have been built upon, and which they are in the process of discarding anyway. It questions the primacy of individual connections and friend networks. It unapologetically embraces central control rather than pretending it doesnt have it. TikToks real influence going forward may be that the other social media platforms decide that our friends were simply holding us back. Or, at least, it was holding them back.",bytedances content platform enable people enjoy content powered ai technology website say vision to build global creation interaction platform bytedances wildly popular news entertainment portal jinri toutiao translated todays headline relies heavily ai  human editor selfselected feed account  curate create customized stream largely userandpartnergenerated content tailored reader service sort filter bubble  isolating user world point view  isnt unintended consequence its point its extremely effective toutiao douyin drawn attention chinese regulator among many thing familiar large socialish platform others unique speechconstrained political environment capturing much user time result tiktoks digital wellbeing setting include option enforce passwordprotected time limit companys challenge addressed assertively algorithmfirst attention market isnt centrally ruled its centrally allocated go long way explain least first tiktok seem disorienting youre actually sure youre seeing youre seeing said ankur thakkar former editorial lead vine tiktoks direct forerunner vine new user might much watch felt much reason create anything understood context list people followed probably thing letting its thing twitter tried solve everyone tried solve said how get people engage apparently show thing let powerful artificial intelligence take note start sending daily notification immediately tell fake till make algorithmically speaking u social platform fighting desperate often stockpricerelated fight increase user engagement trended tiktoks general direction possible today receive highly personalized effectively infinite content recommendation youtube without ever following single account google watch make guess facebook twitter dont talk product way understand sometimes  maybe lot time  use fill time turn want much time possible quite obviously whatever get maybe youll sit tiktok thing way sneaking behind maybe never joined snapchat  rise worried facebook much prettier product instagram remade image copied concept snapchat reached maybe skipped twitter  still rewired entire news diet besides its president talk tiktok away many assumption social platform built upon process discarding anyway question primacy individual connection friend network unapologetically embrace central control rather pretending doesnt tiktoks real influence going forward may social medium platform decide friend simply holding u back least holding back,1

"The government in Beijing on Tuesday used its report to the annual National Peoples Congress to lower its growth goal for the year to a target of 6% to 6.5% and pledged to keep the yuan basically stable at reasonable equilibrium levels, while also allowing greater flexibility.


That suits Chinas own interests, given the risk of capital outflows and market instability that would be triggered by a currency slump. Yet its less clear how much sovereignty over the yuan China will want to cede in any trade agreement with the US.


""It looks unrealistic to us that China would accept any explicit clause putting down ranges for the dollar-yuan rate or incorporating a vigorous monitoring process,"" wrote Frances Cheung, head of Asia macrostrategy at Westpac Banking Corp., in a note Tuesday. ""A rigid exchange-rate policy would have wide implications on Chinas multi-year reform on the foreign-exchange system and the opening-up of capital markets.""

In-display fingerprint scanners are one of the most worked upon features of the smartphone industry. Chinese smartphone company Vivo pioneered the technology that allows people to unlock their smartphones simply by touching their displays. Other players, like Oppo, OnePlus and Huawei quickly caught on to include the technology in their smartphones.


The technology relies on an optical fingerprint sensor, which uses a light source to capture a high-resolution photograph of your fingerprints and uses algorithms to identify unique patterns. To capture a high-resolution image, it requires a light source, which has to be strong enough to illuminate your fingerprint. The problem arises when the light has to hit the sensor after bouncing back from your finger. As a result, this tech can work only with OLED displays, since an LCDs backlight can get in the way.",xiaomis scanner dimension 25mm x 502mm reasonably bigger thumbprint sized indisplay sensor photo lin binweibo indisplay fingerprint scanner one worked upon feature smartphone industry chinese smartphone company vivo pioneered technology allows people unlock smartphones simply touching display player like oppo oneplus huawei quickly caught include technology smartphones technology relies optical fingerprint sensor us light source capture highresolution photograph fingerprint us algorithm identify unique pattern capture highresolution image requires light source strong enough illuminate fingerprint problem arises light hit sensor bouncing back finger result tech work oled display since lcds backlight get way,1

"The story suggested that Sandberg and Zuckerberg werent as involved with the serious issues facing the company as they should have been. Rather the two top executives were more concerned about continuing to defend Facebooks reputation and embarked on an aggressive lobbying campaign to fend off critics.


The report has once again prompted the ire of lawmakers, who summoned Zuckerberg earlier this year for two days of Congressional hearings regarding the Russian affair and data privacy.


Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat who has sought to increase transparency of online political ads, said Thursday that she would write to Facebook and the Justice Department to ask whether any elected officials were targeted in the opposition research. She said it could be a campaign finance issue.


In 2017, Klobuchar proposed legislation to compel Facebook and others to disclose who bought political ads on their sites. The Times said that after a call from Sandberg at the time, Klobuchar dialed back criticism of Facebook, although her office stressed she didnt change the bill in response to the outreach.

The rates under discussion in this case govern payments from on-demand services such as Spotify and Apple Music, which make up the vast majority of streaming sales.

"The PM-Kisan cash transfer scheme launched on 24 February aims to benefit over 120 million farm households across India, and is being rolled out at a breakneck speed to ensure that farmers receive the first instalment before they cast their votes in the Lok Sabha elections starting 11 April. The scheme is expected to cost ?20,000 crore in 2018-19 and ?75,000 crore in 2019-20.


In Uttar Pradesh up to 20 million farmers could benefitand so far about 10.4 million farmers have received the money,"" said Soraj Singh, director of agriculture in the state. If we convert the in-kind allocations for farmers under state schemes they get ?2 per day per family, with PM-Kisan they are getting ?17 per day in cash bank accounts with tiny amounts like ?200-300 are being credited by ?2,000 in a go,"" said Singh, defending the scheme against criticism that the assistance is paltry.


Major farmer organizations have criticized the scheme calling it a bribe"" ahead of elections while politicians like Congress president Rahul Gandhi termed it an insult"" to farmers. Experts and economists too said cash transfers may curtail future public investments in agriculture, like in irrigation or research.


However, the majority of farmers in Uttar Pradeshs Agra, Amethi, Kannauj and Barabanki districts, where Mint travelled last week, perceive the scheme differently, although on ground only a handful of families said they have received the money. Mint chose to travel to these districts in central Uttar Pradesh, which are dominated by small land holding farmers, to understand the economic and electoral impact of PM-Kisan, unlike western parts of the state where farmers owe their relative prosperity to sugarcane cultivation.


Take for instance the opinion of Ram Prasad Yadav, a small farmer from Barabanki: Is ?6,000 nothing? At least we can buy salt and chilies, spend on school books and shoes, buy some clothes farmers may not vote for Modi for this money but there are other reasons to vote for him.""


This other"" reason, an apparent surge of nationalism, has seemingly possessed the rural voter in these parts, be it a young college student about to enter the job market, or a farmer staying awake the entire night to guard his crop from stray cattle. This election is not about the kisan, it is about the nation,"" said 30-year-old Radheshyam Nishad from Agra, when asked how the state government and the centre have helped farmers to get better crop prices or manage recurrent weather risks. What about the stray cattle menace created by a ban on slaughter and risks in transportation of unproductive cattle? We cannot expect the Prime Minister to come and guard our crop.""


The majority of farmers Mint spoke to contend that compensation for crop loss or the state-initiated loan waiver did not reach them due to corrupt bank or local government officials. The stray cattle menace is one of their own making, since it is they who have abandoned cows. The farmers and daily wagers in these villages admit that the federal government has largely ignored their plight but the dissatisfaction which was palpable a few months ago has been replaced by admiration and a sense of pride. More importantly, they are unwilling to blame the Prime Minister for their troubles.",pmkisan cash transfer scheme launched 24 february aim benefit 120 million farm household across india rolled breakneck speed ensure farmer receive first instalment cast vote lok sabha election starting 11 april scheme expected cost 20000 crore 201819 75000 crore 201920 in uttar pradesh 20 million farmer could benefit far 104 million farmer received money said soraj singh director agriculture state if convert inkind allocation farmer state scheme get 2 per day per family pmkisan getting 17 per day cash bank account tiny amount like 200300 credited 2000 go said singh defending scheme criticism assistance paltry major farmer organization criticized scheme calling bribe ahead election politician like congress president rahul gandhi termed insult farmer expert economist said cash transfer may curtail future public investment agriculture like irrigation research however majority farmer uttar pradeshs agra amethi kannauj barabanki district mint travelled last week perceive scheme differently although ground handful family said received money mint chose travel district central uttar pradesh dominated small land holding farmer understand economic electoral impact pmkisan unlike western part state farmer owe relative prosperity sugarcane cultivation take instance opinion ram prasad yadav small farmer barabanki is 6000 nothing least buy salt chilies spend school book shoe buy clothes farmer may vote modi money reason vote other reason apparent surge nationalism seemingly possessed rural voter part young college student enter job market farmer staying awake entire night guard crop stray cattle this election kisan nation said 30yearold radheshyam nishad agra asked state government centre helped farmer get better crop price manage recurrent weather risk stray cattle menace created ban slaughter risk transportation unproductive cattle we expect prime minister come guard crop majority farmer mint spoke contend compensation crop loss stateinitiated loan waiver reach due corrupt bank local government official stray cattle menace one making since abandoned cow farmer daily wager village admit federal government largely ignored plight dissatisfaction palpable month ago replaced admiration sense pride importantly unwilling blame prime minister trouble,0

The BJP hopes to play a decisive role in the state during the Lok Sabha polls and replicate the performance in the assembly elections two years from now.

Modi was voted into power, promising to double farmer incomes by 2022. He also pledged to fight persistent high food inflation, which had triggered anger towards the previous Congress-led government.


His administration tackled hoarders and carried out agriculture marketing reforms that have helped to break the monopoly of licensed traders and lowered marketing costs for farmers.


The introduction of the goods and services tax (GST) in July 2017 has also brought down food transportation costs, according to Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC Holdings Plc, while bumper harvests, both at home and abroad, have helped keep food prices tame.",inflation halved modis regime averaging 48 since 2014 contrast consumerprice growth averaged 10 20092013 modi voted power promising double farmer income 2022 also pledged fight persistent high food inflation triggered anger towards previous congressled government administration tackled hoarder carried agriculture marketing reform helped break monopoly licensed trader lowered marketing cost farmer introduction good service tax gst july 2017 also brought food transportation cost according pranjul bhandari chief india economist hsbc holding plc bumper harvest home abroad helped keep food price tame,0
"It takes the pressure off me,"" said Erin Kraftchick, who typically keeps the cards in her wallet and hands them out when its time to make a purchase.


The Kraftchicks are part of a growing group of busy parents who are trying out app-controlled debit cards to give their offspring allowance, manage chores and teach them about money. Despite talk of a cashless society, physical cash is still widely preferred for small purchases, according to the Federal Reserve. But children may lose cash, or parents may not have it on hand when its time to pay up.


We got tired of having a drawer full of dollars,"" said Brandi Tzonev, a sales manager and personal trainer in Lawrenceville, Georgia, who uses goHenry with her 15-year-old son, Alex, and 10-year-old daughter, Gabriella.


Some banks have long had accounts aimed at children and teenagers, and many families use prepaid debit cards  rather than traditional debit cards, linked to a checking account  as a way to help children manage money. But the newest generation of smart"" debit cards are managed by advanced mobile apps that give parents detailed control over how much the young people spend  and even where they spend  with a few taps on a phone.


In addition to goHenry, which has been available in Britain for five years and moved into the United States this spring, the cards include financial technology startups like Greenlight, backed by Amazon and others, and Current, financed in part by an arm of Fifth Third Bank.


Details vary slightly by card, but in general a parent establishes an account or wallet,"" linked to their traditional checking account. The app draws money from the bank account, and the parent transfers funds electronically to the childs card. The child can spend only what is available on the card. Parents can set spending limits and restrict where cards can be used.",it take pressure said erin kraftchick typically keep card wallet hand its time make purchase kraftchicks part growing group busy parent trying appcontrolled debit card give offspring allowance manage chore teach money despite talk cashless society physical cash still widely preferred small purchase according federal reserve child may lose cash parent may hand its time pay we got tired drawer full dollar said brandi tzonev sale manager personal trainer lawrenceville georgia us gohenry 15yearold son alex 10yearold daughter gabriella bank long account aimed child teenager many family use prepaid debit card  rather traditional debit card linked checking account  way help child manage money newest generation smart debit card managed advanced mobile apps give parent detailed control much young people spend  even spend  tap phone addition gohenry available britain five year moved united state spring card include financial technology startup like greenlight backed amazon others current financed part arm fifth third bank detail vary slightly card general parent establishes account wallet linked traditional checking account app draw money bank account parent transfer fund electronically childs card child spend available card parent set spending limit restrict card used,1

To develop the sensor, the researchers from Pennsylvania State University in the US used a protein they recently described and subsequently used to explore the biology of bacteria that use lanthanides.


Rare earth metals are found in varying quantities in smartphones.

"Pawars nephew Ajit hasnt been able to step out of the Maval constituency where his son Parth is up against Shiv Senas Shrirang Barne to campaign for other NCP nominees.


As 14 Maharashtra seats go to polls on Tuesday, the NCP, founded two decades ago by Pawar, is fighting a battle for survival against a rampaging BJP-Shiv Sena-Republican Party of India alliance.


In 2014, the NCP won only four Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra. One of its four members of Parliament (MPs) Vijaysinh Mohite-Patil shared the stage with Modi at a BJP rally last week in Akluj while Patils son Ranjeetsinh has already joined the BJP. In Dindori near Nashik, the BJP has poached Bharati Pawar from the NCP and fielded her.

"Sophisticated machine learningconsidered a subset of artificial intelligenceand deep learning (a machine learning technique) algorithms are being trained on humongous amounts of data to draw inferences and patterns that can help firms make better business decisions. The increase in computing power is only helping artificial intelligence do this task, faster and almost in real-time. Artificial intelligence is already in your smartphones in the form of voice assistants, smarter cameras that can auto correct the focus and sharpen pictures, intelligent email inbox, etc.


Artificial intelligence is also doing image recognition, speech recognition, besides powering self-driving cars and powering smart home automation devices. Yet, there are concerns since unsupervised deep learning neural networks (loosely modelled on the human brain) are still largely unexplained black boxes. This has given rise to the concept of Explainable AI, pressuring the neural networks to explain how they arrived at a decision just as we humans do.


Blockchain, the technology that powers cryptocurrencies, is another tool that holds a lot of promise in terms of reducing costs, building efficiencies and establishing trust. But there are challenges like slower speeds (4,000 or so) of processing transactions (compared to say a master card or visa card that does almost 40,000).


Besides, most pilots across the world are being done with private (permissioned) blockchains that can perform thousands of transactions per second but cannot be termed as true blockchains since they are distributed digital databases being run on a private network. Nevertheless, in whatever form it runs, blockchain (or whatever we eventually may call it) remains a promising technology.",sophisticated machine learningconsidered subset artificial intelligenceand deep learning machine learning technique algorithm trained humongous amount data draw inference pattern help firm make better business decision increase computing power helping artificial intelligence task faster almost realtime artificial intelligence already smartphones form voice assistant smarter camera auto correct focus sharpen picture intelligent email inbox etc artificial intelligence also image recognition speech recognition besides powering selfdriving car powering smart home automation device yet concern since unsupervised deep learning neural network loosely modelled human brain still largely unexplained black box given rise concept explainable ai pressuring neural network explain arrived decision human blockchain technology power cryptocurrencies another tool hold lot promise term reducing cost building efficiency establishing trust challenge like slower speed 4000 processing transaction compared say master card visa card almost 40000 besides pilot across world done private permissioned blockchains perform thousand transaction per second termed true blockchains since distributed digital databases run private network nevertheless whatever form run blockchain whatever eventually may call remains promising technology,1

"The Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPM the principal enemy of Congress in Kerala had last week announced P. Rajeev as their candidate from Ernakulam. Rajeev was lauded across party lines as a former Rajya Sabha member and has been in charge of the party in Ernakulam for the last few years and editor of the CPM mouthpiece, positions that allowed him to build a rapport in the constituency.


In short, Rajeev is not all a weak candidate and this may have prompted the party to give the seat to a relatively younger face. Eden, 35 is the son of late Congress leader George Eden, who rose up as a student leader to become a two-time Ernakulam MLA.

Everyone wants to collect data. But very few people have really found a meaningful use. When I look around, I feel that there is more hype than reality. I think the next 5-10 years will be spent in getting overexcited over this stuff and very few will be able to convert the data to deliver life changing experiences.

"The new OMEN is surprisingly compact. HP has reduced the width of the bezels around the display, giving the screen a more edge-to-edge look, on the lines of the new Macbook Pro notebooks.

"The Indus Water Treaty (IWT), signed in 1960 between the then prime minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru and president of Pakistan Ayub Khan, brokered by World Bank, put constraints on the usage of water resources for hydropower generation and irrigation capacity building for Jammu and Kashmir. This involves an opportunity costthe J&K state under the treaty provisions is entitled to use river water resources for hydropower generation and shall not create irrigation capacity building beyond 1.1 million acres.


Hydropower generation is possible provided there is a dam of requisite height. The three rivers, subjected to IWT bottleneck, are Sindh, Jhelum and Chenab flowing through J&K and these rivers survive on snowfall in winter, which in any case is a lean period for power generation because of low level of water, which lasts seven months.

"The build-up to the OnePlus 7 has begun. The companys next smartphone is ruling search rankings in India and worldwide, but lets take a look at what the leaks really mean for us consumers.


It seems OnePlus has finally learned its lesson after the OnePlus 3, 5 and 6 series. The company has often taken flak for launching the 3T, 5T and 6T models soon after the originals. This year, OnePlus CEO Pete Lau confirmed to The Verge that there will be two devices at launch, the OnePlus 7 and OnePlus 7 Pro.


In his conversation with The Verge, and an earlier tweet, Lau said that the OnePlus 7 Pros display will redefine fast and smooth"".


While Lau wouldnt confirm the same, its likely that the company is taking a page out of Asus, Razer and others playbook. The new display is likely going to have higher refresh rates (90Hz and above), which would theoretically make it feel smoother during UI animations, games etc.

On the move: Toyota has partnered with Amazon, Uber for e-Palette an?electric, autonomous minivan for mass transit, deliveries and mobile offices


Some Silicon Valley entrepreneurs say things like the home of the future will have no kitchen and no garage"". While this may seem far-fetched, in some cities it is possible to see how this might be true. The rise of ubiquitous connectivity and a generation that values convenience suggests that it is worth re-thinking the idea of the city of tomorrow.


First and foremost, it is critical to recognize that the city has always been intricately intertwined with mobility. The attractiveness of urbanizationaccess to opportunity, diversity, culture, educationis largely about social mobility, but none of that is possible without physical mobility.


The aspiration of city residents has led to outward expansion. Finding an affordable home with sufficient space, living in a community of like-minded people, and owning a vehicle for the freedom to get around have all become characteristics of the peri-urban lifestyle. The result is an aspirational society that spends at least one hour of the day getting from one place to another.


The urban sprawl starts for similar reasons: overshooting of intended density and then affordability, forcing growing populations to expand cities spatially. This leads to suboptimal density of urban settlements and, in turn, lengthens commute and vehicle kilometers travelled, which in turn leads to de-densification.",majority mobility use case served better maas mobility service ownership nyt shared tech gm testing autonomous ev fleet chevy bolt plan launch commercial ridesharing service year move toyota partnered amazon uber epalette anelectric autonomous minivan mass transit delivery mobile office silicon valley entrepreneur say thing like the home future kitchen garage may seem farfetched city possible see might true rise ubiquitous connectivity generation value convenience suggests worth rethinking idea city tomorrow first foremost critical recognize city always intricately intertwined mobility attractiveness urbanizationaccess opportunity diversity culture educationis largely social mobility none possible without physical mobility aspiration city resident led outward expansion finding affordable home sufficient space living community likeminded people owning vehicle freedom get around become characteristic periurban lifestyle result aspirational society spends least one hour day getting one place another urban sprawl start similar reason overshooting intended density affordability forcing growing population expand city spatially lead suboptimal density urban settlement turn lengthens commute vehicle kilometer travelled turn lead dedensification,1

"Apple has negotiated with the likes of HBO, Starz and Showtime but the centerpiece will be original programming


On March 25, a delegation of producers, studio executives and name actors will enter the subterranean 1,000-seat Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino, California, for one of those Apple showcases, with the chief executive, Tim Cook, commanding the stage before a crowd of loyalists.


This time around, the focus wont be on the next must-have device. With iPhone sales showing signs of fatigue, the event is intended to draw attention to the companys billion-dollar-plus bet on entertainment, an initiative that will put Apple in direct competition with Netflix, Amazon and HBO.


The premiere date for the service is getting closer, with the first of a dozen or more shows likely to start streaming before the year is out. At next weeks presentation, Apple is expected to reveal details of what it has been working on with stars from both sides of the camera like Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Aniston, Brie Larson, Jason Momoa, Octavia Spencer, J.J. Abrams, M. Night Shyamalan and Steven Spielberg.


The tag line, Its show time,"" appeared prominently on the invitations. For many of the show-business people, this will be their first trip to Cupertino, the corporate home of their new patrons.


Apple didnt need stars before, but it needs them now. Although the company was the first publicly traded American firm to be valued above $1 trillion, its most recent earnings report showed flat profits and falling revenue.


So the plan is not only to sell devices, but to fill them with content. That has led the company into the alien territory of Hollywood, where local customs can clash with Silicon Valley folkways.


Apple is a relatively late arrival to streaming. Netflix, Amazon and Hulu have offered original programming for several years and are now formidable presences at the Emmys. In 2018, there were nearly 500 scripted television shows available in the United States, with Netflix spending at least $8 billion on new content. Amazon, the Walt Disney Co. and Warner Media have increased their programming budgets to keep pace.


Apple has decided to put more emphasis on its services  think Apple Music and Apple Pay  to increase revenues. The strategy will include an expansion of Apple News, which is expected to be highlighted at the showcase, and the star-studded streaming service. Apple has negotiated with the likes of HBO, Starz and Showtime to populate its screens, Bloomberg has reported, but the centerpiece will be original programming.",apple negotiated like hbo starz showtime centerpiece original programming march 25 delegation producer studio executive name actor enter subterranean 1000seat steve job theater cupertino california one apple showcase chief executive tim cook commanding stage crowd loyalist time around focus wont next musthave device iphone sale showing sign fatigue event intended draw attention companys billiondollarplus bet entertainment initiative put apple direct competition netflix amazon hbo premiere date service getting closer first dozen show likely start streaming year next weeks presentation apple expected reveal detail working star side camera like reese witherspoon jennifer aniston brie larson jason momoa octavia spencer jj abrams night shyamalan steven spielberg tag line its show time appeared prominently invitation many showbusiness people first trip cupertino corporate home new patron apple didnt need star need although company first publicly traded american firm valued 1 trillion recent earnings report showed flat profit falling revenue plan sell device fill content led company alien territory hollywood local custom clash silicon valley folkways apple relatively late arrival streaming netflix amazon hulu offered original programming several year formidable presence emmy 2018 nearly 500 scripted television show available united state netflix spending least 8 billion new content amazon walt disney co warner medium increased programming budget keep pace apple decided put emphasis service  think apple music apple pay  increase revenue strategy include expansion apple news expected highlighted showcase starstudded streaming service apple negotiated like hbo starz showtime populate screen bloomberg reported centerpiece original programming,1

"While the survey findings are still mostly positive, the declines are a worrying shift for Google, which prides itself on high employee morale, luxurious working conditions and high pay. If these things are beginning to erode, the company could lose talent to other technology companies, undermining its ability to build new services that drive its profitable advertising business.


Last year, tension between the company and employees exploded into the public realm. Workers clashed with management on a range of issues, including a lack of benefits for contract staff and the ethical use of artificial intelligence. Thousands of Google staff staged a walkout after a report that the company gave large exit payments to executives accused of sexual harassment.

"Irrespective of the results, this will be the first election in the state since the passing of Jayalalithaa (in December 2016) and Karunanidhi (in August 2018).


If Karunanidhi dominated Tamil Nadu politics for half a century, Jayalalithaa shared this domination in a bitter rivalry with him for at least half of that period. Both left deep imprints on national politics as well. If Karunanidhi propped up at least two Union governmentsthe United Front in 1996 and the UPA I in 2004Jayalalithaa toppled the BJP-led NDA government in April 1999 after giving it a hard time for 13 months, when its very survival depended on her support. Shortly after, she brought a Congress coalition tantalizingly close to power.


In the 2014 parliamentary elections, her party coined the slogan: Modi or the Lady?"" Jayalalithaa swept the polls winning 37 out of 39 seats on her own, garnering an astonishing 44.5% of votes. But it was a pyrrhic victory, as the Modi-led BJP won a majority thus putting a wrench in her national plans, and Mamata Bannerjees ambitions as well.


Admittedly both Karunanidhi and Jayalalithaa have cast a long shadow on Tamil Nadu politics. Predictions that the AIADMK will implode have been belied. The day of reckoning for the AIADMK government has been postponed with the chief minister Palaniswami skating on thin ice with more than a little support from New Delhi. If by-elections for 21 seats vacated by the disqualification of 21 Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) for voting against the partys whip is to be held simultaneously, it would amount to a general election to form the state government.


Elections 2019 will decide many things. How will the two Dravidian majors fare after the demise of their towering leaders? What will be the shape of the DMK in the post-Karunanidhi era? How many of AIADMKs traditional voters will remain with the official party, and how much will be garnered by its challenger, Dhinakaran? Will smaller parties continue to tilt the scales?


But then these are the mere trees. One should not miss the woods. Ultimately, the big question is: who will have the finger on the nuclear button in the event of a coalition government? In plain terms, will Modi have a shot at power again by looking beyond the Hindi heartland? Or in other words, what can the BJP reasonably hope to gain from Tamil Nadu? Even a die-hard bhakt would not bet on more than one of the five seats. The bottom line for the BJP in Tamil Nadu boils down to little more than limiting the Congress victory.

"U.S. Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat and leading critic of social media, told Reuters in a statement that large platforms increasingly are ""taking more and more data from users, for wider and more far-reaching uses, without any corresponding compensation to the user.""


Warner said he is drafting legislation that would require Facebook to ""disclose the value of users' data, and tell users exactly how their data is being monetized.""


Human-powered content labeling, also referred to as ""data annotation,"" is a growth industry as companies seek to harness data for AI training and other purposes.


Self-driving car companies such as Alphabet Inc's Waymo have labelers identify traffic lights and pedestrians in videos to fortify their AI. Voice assistant developers including Amazon.com Inc have people annotate customer audio to improve AI's ability to decipher speech.


Facebook launched the Wipro project in April last year. The Indian firm received a $4 million contract and formed a team of about 260 labelers, according to the workers. Last year, the work consisted of analyzing posts from the prior five years.


After completing that, the team in December was cut to about 30 and shifted to labeling each month posts from the prior month. Work is expected to last through at least the end of 2019, they said.


The company said its analysis is ongoing so it could not provide any findings from the labeling or resulting product decisions. It has not told labelers the purpose or results of the project, and the workers said all they have inferred from their limited view is that selfies are increasingly popular.


The Wipro labelers and Facebook said the posts are a random sampling of text-based status updates, shared links, event posts, Stories feature uploads, videos and photos, including user-posted screenshots of chats on Facebook's various messaging apps.

"The pressure from moderation in aluminium prices can be seen on a sequential basis. Operating profit at the aluminium segment dropped 4.7% from the September quarter. But thanks to better volumes and realizations in the copper business, Hindalco (stand-alone plus Utkal Alumina) managed to maintain the operating profit at the September-quarter level.


With coal availability improving and crude oil-based raw material prices easing, the management expects the input cost base to either remain flat or moderate in the current quarter.


Further, with the US-based subsidiary Novelis Inc. seeing decent growth (operating profit up 5.6%), Hindalco should see another steady quarter (Q4 FY19), unless the global economic situation turns for the worse. Cost competitiveness in Hindalcos India operations driven by increased coal security, quick ramp-up of new capacities and high margins at Novelis/Aleris with higher proportion of automotive products in the mix continues to drive an upward earnings trajectory for the consolidated entity,"" analysts at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd said in a 5 February note.

"With over 9 million views on YouTube, the Holi spot Rang laaye sang (loosely translated to colours that bring us together) which features an innocent bond between a little Hindu girl and a Muslim boy, has been targeted for Love Jihad vilification on social media platforms.


The campaign message of bringing people together and showing how colours can be an equalizer in society resonated with the netizens but not with the troll army which made #BoycottHindustanUnilever and #BoycottSurfExcel trend. However, there is an emerging parallel narrative on the micro-blogging platform with people standing up for the brand tweeting with hashtags #stopdivisiveness.


HUL said it stands by the campaign adding that in the last decade, the brand has advertised on the philosophy of Daag Acche Hain (Dirt is Good).

"This year, Huaweis chief financial officer was arrested in Canada at the behest of the US. Photo: Reuters


Las Vegas: The CES 2019 gadget show, which kicks off Sunday, will showcase the expanding influence and sway of Chinas rapidly growing technology sector. But some of its firms are stepping back from the spotlight amid rising US national-security concerns over Chinese tech and a trans-Pacific trade war launched by President Donald Trump.


Last year, a top executive of the Chinese telecom firm Huawei delivered a CES keynote address critical of AT&Ts abrupt cancellation of plans to sell a Huawei phone following espionage concerns raised by the US government. This year, Huaweis chief financial officer was arrested in Canada at the behest of the US; Meng Wanzhou, daughter of Huaweis founder, now awaits US extradition. No Chinese technology executives will deliver CES keynotes in Las Vegas this week.


There are fewer Chinese entrepreneurs buying up booth space to show off their latest technology  more than 20% fewer exhibitors than last year, according to registration numbers tracked by the South China Morning Post. Chinese firms still account for more than a quarter of the conferences 4,500 exhibitors, second only to the US in sheer numbers. But some of the biggest names are taking a more subdued approach.


Internet company Baidu last year hosted a flashy event touting its self-driving software, but this year is sticking to a more conventional booth. E-commerce giant Alibaba is eschewing the big outdoor tent it helped erect last year in favor of quieter meetings marketing its voice assistant to business partners.

"Which party, then, would they pick as first-time voters in the ongoing general elections? It took only a slight squabble for a disyllabic consensus to emerge (or be articulated): NOTA"". If None of the Above"" were to turn out the top choice of the electorate, they held, then a repoll ought to be ordered. Its the only way to keep bad candidates out,"" said one. The corrupt,"" specified another.


Would all the other voters out there agree? A mix of doubt and gloom appeared to hush the hostel room for a moment before Prashant Dixit, 23, ventured his analysis of Indian democracys principal problem: andh-bhakti (blind devotion) and polarization"". He was particularly put off by a troll attack hed suffered the other day for sharing a video clip of Ravish Kumar on social media. Why do politicians only address sensitive issues? What about jobs? Thats No. 1 as a common issue. Health? Infrastructure? Education?"" It served as a cue for others to speak up. Even a peons job takes a bribe."" Recruitment exam papers always get leaked."" In the name of jobs also, there is now divisive talk.""


The youth are not being given a chance,"" said Sachin Kumar Yadav, 20, whod been content to listen all this while. Yes, why is that?"" added Dixit, People will want an answer.""


The curse of caste politics didnt take long to rear itself. So long as the whole system is not reformed, this will go on,"" said Shukla, Politicians wont reform their ways, therell still be buying tickets to contest elections."" There was no getting away from the likes of Pragya Thakur and Azam Khan, said someone, at which reminders were exchanged of their ugly words. The courts, social media, Election Commission of India (ECI) and others were all complicit in this mahaul, this environment, said someone else, even as disgust was aired at lynch mobs, anti-national"" labels and the national mediathis time round, for not asking why Pulwamas martyrs were denied an airlift. Bhakts, the gathering felt, were a creation of the media.


On defence, though, it was quickly pointed out, the Prime Minister had done good work. Whether this meant Modi would get another term in office was met with many a nod of agreement. As Pathak summed it up, There is no vikalp (alternative).""


The sense that the 17th Lok Sabha was already in the BJPs bag seemed to prevail even more heavily in Old Lucknow.

Every hardware innovation has been aided, in no small part, by software innovation. The software on the Mate X and other foldable phones is plain Android. Theres no effort, except in changing screen orientations (which was inevitable), to even do something clever with a screen that folds. Will we really use foldable phones for split screen apps only? Could Huawei not have put a clock on the curved part of the screen when its folded? And can Samsung think of something better? In fact, can the bar that holds the cameras on the Mate X have a separate battery that charges the phone whenever it is in phone mode? All questions worth asking.

"If you dig deep into the headline of Stop killer robots, it is not looking at the notion of a Terminator-like robot that will take over the world.

The impact of lower GST in the absence of input tax credit, therefore, will vary based on the region and the project. For instance, projects in Mumbai and Delhi or Gurugram, where land cost is high, may have less pressure on margins, as they can build in the increase in cost into the price. But those in south India, such as Bengaluru, and non-metros such as Pune, where cost of land is relatively lower, and the share of developmental cost is higher, will feel the heat on margins.

"Censors are omnipresent. Nothing goes unmonitored and anything that even vaguely smells suspicious invites immediate reprisal. When a few Chinese bloggers humorously compared Chinese President Xi Jinping to the cuddly Winnie the Pooh, the government blocked all search requests for the beloved fictional bear.


According to Amnesty International, China has the largest number of imprisoned cyber-dissidents in the world. And its getting scarier. China is training and providing technology to other authoritarian regimes on net censorship. This is a serious threat to democracy around the world.


The government says that this will protect the countrys internet from foreign cyberattacks or other threats. But international human rights groups and Putins opponents say it is an attempt to restrict information flow.


The proposal is to route all Russian internet and data through a central point controlled by the state. Theoretically, this would allow the government to cut off the Russian internet from the rest of the global network. The law would grant more powers to Roskomnadzor, the Kremlins federal censor. This will be, quite simply, the new iron curtain.


India has a much better record on internet freedom. Governments have mostly concentrated on blocking porn sites and specific URLs that were allegedly spreading misinformation. In democracy watchdog Freedom Houses Freedom on the Net 2018 report (bit.ly/2zhm7tu), India ranks 30th among the 65 countries surveyed. But that could change for the worse and it could be done so smoothly by a clever government that we might not even notice until our rights were already severely curtailed.


With the elections beginning within a fortnight from now, echo chambers and fake news are grave dangers. And in the last few years, social media in India has been flooded with fake news and hate speech. Deliberately falsified or misleading content is a powerful tool in the hands of politicians. But it cuts both ways. Politicians can also use fake news"" as a pretext to suppress facts. Our rationality will be facing some very tough tests in the coming weeks.


So, 30 years on, the internet needs some serious fixing. The very future of how we run our lives and societies may be at stake. Is it possible at all? In the words of Sir Tim: Given how much the Web has changed in the past 30 years, it would be defeatist and unimaginative to assume that the Web as we know it cant be changed for the better in the next 30. If we give up on building a better Web now, then the Web will not have failed us. We will have failed the Web.""

"It takes a group of young men 45 minutes to locate a dusty photo of RJD strongman Lalu Prasad in his house in Phulwaria, the village where he was born. (Pradeep Gaur/Mint)


Lalu Prasad has built a reputation as a mass leader who drew crowds with his inimitable style of canvassing


In the 2015 assembly elections, Lalu Prasad led the alliance that blocked the Bharatiya Janata Partys (BJPs) entry in Bihar


GOPALGANJ/CHAPRA: Phulwaria in Bihars Gopalganj district is like any village in the Hindi belt, and chances are most people havent heard of it. But, it is the absence of its most famous former resident that puts it centre stage in this Lok Sabha election. Phulwaria is the birth place of Lalu Prasad, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) president and former chief minister, now serving a jail sentence in the fodder scam.


Though Prasad sought bail, which was rejected, to carry out essential responsibilities as a party president"" ahead of the election, there are no photos or statues of him in his village. On one new year greeting poster"" by a local RJD leader a tiny mugshot of Prasad jostles for space with 16 other leaders. It takes a group of excited young men and a 45-minute hunt to finally locate one dusty old photograph of Bihars former chief ministerbut they are effusive in their praise of him.


He is everything, our hero, our God. He once belonged to his village; now this village belongs to him. His absence has made this campaign dull. He was the voice of backward communities and that is missing now,"" said Chandan Yadav, a 23-year-old student who lives in the village. He dismissed Prasads conviction in the fodder scam as a political conspiracy"".


Currently serving his sentence in Ranchi, this is the first election in which Prasad is not campaigning since launching the RJD in 1997. Its also the first election hell be missing in more than 40 years since joining student politics in the 1970s. He was elected to the Lok Sabha for the first time in 1977 at the age of 29. He has since served as five-time MP, four-time MLA, Union railways minister, twice chief minister and Rajya Sabha member.


Prasad has built a reputation as a mass leader who drew crowds with his inimitable style of canvassing  whether his animated mimicry of opponents, his catchy one-liners or social engineering like his appeals to MY, or Muslim-Yadav support base. RJD is contesting 20 seats this election as part of the mahagathbandhan or grand alliance with the Congress, which is contesting nine seats.",take group young men 45 minute locate dusty photo rjd strongman lalu prasad house phulwaria village born pradeep gaurmint lalu prasad built reputation mass leader drew crowd inimitable style canvassing 2015 assembly election lalu prasad led alliance blocked bharatiya janata partys bjps entry bihar gopalganjchapra phulwaria bihars gopalganj district like village hindi belt chance people havent heard absence famous former resident put centre stage lok sabha election phulwaria birth place lalu prasad rashtriya janata dal rjd president former chief minister serving jail sentence fodder scam though prasad sought bail rejected carry essential responsibility party president ahead election photo statue village one new year greeting poster local rjd leader tiny mugshot prasad jostle space 16 leader take group excited young men 45minute hunt finally locate one dusty old photograph bihars former chief ministerbut effusive praise he everything hero god belonged village village belongs absence made campaign dull voice backward community missing said chandan yadav 23yearold student life village dismissed prasads conviction fodder scam a political conspiracy currently serving sentence ranchi first election prasad campaigning since launching rjd 1997 its also first election hell missing 40 year since joining student politics 1970s elected lok sabha first time 1977 age 29 since served fivetime mp fourtime mla union railway minister twice chief minister rajya sabha member prasad built reputation mass leader drew crowd inimitable style canvassing  whether animated mimicry opponent catchy oneliners social engineering like appeal my muslimyadav support base rjd contesting 20 seat election part mahagathbandhan grand alliance congress contesting nine seat,0

A high school drop-out, Mohanty likes his workplace, Sanand, in Ahmedabad, but given a chance he would like to settle down and work in his home state.


I would like to stay and work in Odisha, but jobs are a real challenge here,"" he said at the Panchasakha complex in Puri district, which is known for its role in Indias freedom struggle and evolution of linguistic identity of Odisha.


Mohanty, 24, is not the only one. His two elder brothers are already working in Gujarat. His friends, including Manas Sethi and Somanath Malik, are also preparing to leave Odisha in search for jobs. These youngsters represent two key challenges for Odishajobs and migration, which happen to dominate the political discourse in the state.

"The ride-hailing company is planning to start marketing shares to potential investors in a price range of about $44 to $50 each, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter isnt public. Uber could aim to raise about $8 billion to $10 billion in the listing, though the final details of the pricing may still change, the people said.


At the lower end of the range the price would value Uber just above its last private funding round, in which Toyota Motor Corp. invested at a valuation of about $76 billion. Uber is taking a conservative approach to its valuation and could later raise the price depending on investor demand, the people said. Last year, bankers jockeying to lead the offering told Uber it could be valued at as much as $120 billion in an IPO.


The IPO is reportedly drawing big-name investors. PayPal Holdings Inc. will buy roughly $500 million of shares via a private placement at Ubers IPO price, the Wall Street Journal cited unidentified people as saying.


Some recent big listings by technology unicorns have seen valuations come back down to earth after years of access to huge pools of private capital. Shares of Lyft Inc., which made its market debut in March at a $20.5 billion valuation, have since dropped 22 percent to well below their IPO price. Ubers ride-hailing rival has a market value of $16.1 billion as of Thursday, much closer to its last private funding round at $15.1 billion.",ridehailing company planning start marketing share potential investor price range 44 50 said people asked identified matter isnt public uber could aim raise 8 billion 10 billion listing though final detail pricing may still change people said lower end range price would value uber last private funding round toyota motor corp invested valuation 76 billion uber taking conservative approach valuation could later raise price depending investor demand people said last year banker jockeying lead offering told uber could valued much 120 billion ipo ipo reportedly drawing bigname investor paypal holding inc buy roughly 500 million share via private placement ubers ipo price wall street journal cited unidentified people saying recent big listing technology unicorn seen valuation come back earth year access huge pool private capital share lyft inc made market debut march 205 billion valuation since dropped 22 percent well ipo price ubers ridehailing rival market value 161 billion thursday much closer last private funding round 151 billion,3

"Holding elections in worlds seventh largest nation by area and second most populous country is humongous and complex


There will be 15 million voters aged 18-19 years voting in this years poll and millions more first time voters


NEW DELHI: Its election season in India. The South Asian nation is preparing to hold general elections in April and May, in which about 900 million Indians -- more than the population of all the countries of Europe combined -- will cast their votes to select a new federal government.


Indias elections have been notoriously difficult to predict because of the endless possibilities of coalitions. It will be no walk in the park for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to retain power -- after five years in office his popularity is receding over concerns about his governments failure to create the promised millions of jobs and as well as a lag in economic development.


But its no cakewalk either for the opposition Congress party -- led by Rahul Gandhi -- and its allies to snatch power as they have yet to gain traction with the electorate. Add to that, the political scene will become even murkier when the powerful regional parties spell out their strategy on multi-party alliances. Contributing to the uncertainty, its difficult to fully trust Indias opinion polls as they have repeatedly failed to predict outcomes.


Voters are electing lawmakers for the 543-member lower house of parliament, or Lok Sabha. In 2014, the Election Commission of India deployed 3.7 million polling staff, 550,000 security personnel, 56 helicopters and 570 special trains to conduct a five-week-long exercise in close to a million polling stations.",holding election worlds seventh largest nation area second populous country humongous complex 15 million voter aged 1819 year voting years poll million first time voter new delhi its election season india south asian nation preparing hold general election april may 900 million indian population country europe combined cast vote select new federal government indias election notoriously difficult predict endless possibility coalition walk park prime minister narendra modi retain power five year office popularity receding concern governments failure create promised million job well lag economic development its cakewalk either opposition congress party led rahul gandhi ally snatch power yet gain traction electorate add political scene become even murkier powerful regional party spell strategy multiparty alliance contributing uncertainty its difficult fully trust indias opinion poll repeatedly failed predict outcome voter electing lawmaker 543member lower house parliament lok sabha 2014 election commission india deployed 37 million polling staff 550000 security personnel 56 helicopter 570 special train conduct fiveweeklong exercise close million polling station,0

"In a poll campaign that has witnessed some high-voltage exchanges on nationalism and national security, Rajasthans south-western border belt is curiously quiet on the topic. The southern half of Rajasthan (comprising 13 of the states 25 Lok Sabha seats) goes to polls on Monday.


Despite the lukewarm traction for a strident anti-Pakistan viewpoint in these parts, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) campaign in Jaisalmer-Barmer has relied heavily on it. In a rally in Jaisalmer on Thursday, BJP candidate Kailash Choudhary declared: Pressing kamal (lotus, the BJPs symbol) is like shooting down one terrorist"". Despite leading farmer agitations in the past and contesting in a state where farmer anger is rife, Choudharys only pitch is nationalism.


The BJP campaign in the Jaisalmer-Barmer region has been filled with errors. First, popular local scion Manvendra Singh (BJP veteran Jaswant Singhs son) defected to the Congress in September 2018. Then, the BJP spent months trying to find a strong candidate and fell back on Choudhary, who is seen to be backed by the RSS. Finally, former chief minister Vasundhara Raje is widely perceived to be angry about being left out of candidate selection in southern Rajasthan. After weeks of will she, wont she"", Raje arrived in Jaisalmer-Jodhpur for the last two days of campaigning. But her arrival was met with mockery. Maybe its a plot to make Choudhary lose,"" said Padam Shankar Singh, who was at Rajes rally. The anger against Raje, who was voted out in December, is palpable.


Despite the odds, both Congress and BJP insiders say a tough contest"" is on the cards and the result may come down to local caste dynamics. The reason: the Modi leher"" (wave). BJP would have perhaps found the going easier in Jaisalmer if the campaign had been nationalism plus"".


Most Modi backers in the arid western edge of the Thar Desert speak about vikas (development), not the Balakot airstrikes. Vikas is my first priority. Everything else comes next,"" says Swarup Bhargav (21), a first-time voter in Ramgarh. Nobody believes Rahul Gandhis (minimum income) promise of ?72,000. I voted for the Congress in the assembly polls but now Im voting for Modi. He (Rahul) has no ability to run the nation.""

"The telecom playbook should be extended to mobility: active policy-setting, regulatory leadership, technology adoption, and private sector participation, leading to ubiquitous and equitable access to all forms of transportation.


Actors across finance, transport, and logistics come together in real-time while facilitated by a cloud service.


While this coordination is evident, it often goes underrepresented in the measured aspects of the mobility economy, barely accounting for 7.1% of the GDP contribution. In this light, MaaS has significant potential in India. We need to make it possible to get from one place to another, regardless of the mode of transit, with an easy-to-use interface and seamless payment.


With multimodal routing, booking, and billing, MaaS has potential to cater to the current market by creating a roaming ecosystem, wherein the perception of competition between public transport and para-transit is reduced. Various modes of transportation work together to form a single service. Involvement of a variety of transport leads to reduced over-reliance on one mode, while at the same time increases the attractiveness of public transport.


National and state governments should continue working together to further empower the digitization of urban mobility. This will strengthen the role of public transport investments and shape our cities to be fundamentally different from an inevitable expansive sprawl.

"Modi, meanwhile, has donned the role of a statesman since becoming the Prime Minister of India, at least on Twitter. It is the second rung of the BJP which has kept its Twitter blades sharpened. Rahuls aggressive debut in late 2017 also coincided with the opening of the floodgates into a new era of antagonistic political messaging on social media. All the major parties were by then online, and many had realized their electoral prospects and brand images were sufficiently impacted by what happened on social media. Congress leaders joined Twitter en masse; Akhilesh Yadav went from chief minister of Uttar Pradesh to opposition leader; and Trinamool Congress chief and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee moved to openly confronting Modi, and presenting herself as the consolidator of the regional challenge to the BJP regime.


Mamata has for nearly two years focused significantly on potential allies in other parts of the country. Mamatas national ambitions"" were initially crafted via banal Twitter greetings and birthday wishes, much before an anti-BJP alliance"" became a publicly stated political goal. The firebrand Bengali leader exchanged online pleasantries with many politicians, from Omar Abdullah to M.K. Stalin, through 2017 and 2018.


However, being a non-Hindi speaking leader has its limitations. Mamata has been pushed to tweet far more in English than Bangla (see chart 3), denting the projection of an online persona which is closer to her aggressive, street fighter image. The Mamata on Twitter is a far cry from the Mamata in real life, although, even online, the issue of a national strongman invading Bengal is one of her favourite topics.


Unlike Mamata, Akhilesh has turned almost entirely inward, with Uttar Pradesh-centric issues dominating his attention span. Up until mid-2017, he had very little confrontational posturing, but the proportion of antagonistic tweeting increased dramatically around late 2017uncannily mirroring Rahul Gandhi. Something clearly changed in the political hawa"" in the run-up to the Gujarat polls of December 2017. Akhilesh who also largely tweeted in English till 2016 now relies almost exclusively on Hindi (see chart 3).


Mamata Banerjee mostly tweets in English in an effort to reach a wider national audience. Amit Shah and Akhilesh Yadav, however, rely heavily on Hindi.


Unlike Rahul Gandhi and Amit Shah, whose antagonistic tweeting lean much more significantly towards name-calling, Akhilesh uses a quirky Lucknowi"" style of sarcasm, humour, and rhyme in his political attacks. Of all the politicians, Akhilesh is the most adept at metaphor and turns of phrase. In short, language and style are central to the public outreach of Akhilesh Yadav. As a result, almost unnoticed, Akhilesh has emerged as a key oppositional voice in the Twittersphere.


But the biggest beneficiary of online confrontation remains Rahul Gandhi, whose reach and virality have skyrocketed since the winter of 2017. Three significant findings emerge from a temporal analysis of Gandhis tweets. First, Rahul consistently gets more replies to his tweets than most other politicians and most of them tend to be from detractors. In short, while his messages are more viral, there is also a much more aggressive countering of his messages through direct replies.",modi meanwhile donned role statesman since becoming prime minister india least twitter second rung bjp kept twitter blade sharpened rahuls aggressive debut late 2017 also coincided opening floodgate new era antagonistic political messaging social medium major party online many realized electoral prospect brand image sufficiently impacted happened social medium congress leader joined twitter en masse akhilesh yadav went chief minister uttar pradesh opposition leader trinamool congress chief west bengal chief minister mamata banerjee moved openly confronting modi presenting consolidator regional challenge bjp regime mamata nearly two year focused significantly potential ally part country mamatas national ambition initially crafted via banal twitter greeting birthday wish much antibjp alliance became publicly stated political goal firebrand bengali leader exchanged online pleasantry many politician omar abdullah mk stalin 2017 2018 however nonhindi speaking leader limitation mamata pushed tweet far english bangla see chart 3 denting projection online persona closer aggressive street fighter image mamata twitter far cry mamata real life although even online issue national strongman invading bengal one favourite topic unlike mamata akhilesh turned almost entirely inward uttar pradeshcentric issue dominating attention span mid2017 little confrontational posturing proportion antagonistic tweeting increased dramatically around late 2017uncannily mirroring rahul gandhi something clearly changed political hawa runup gujarat poll december 2017 akhilesh also largely tweeted english till 2016 relies almost exclusively hindi see chart 3 mamata banerjee mostly tweet english effort reach wider national audience amit shah akhilesh yadav however rely heavily hindi unlike rahul gandhi amit shah whose antagonistic tweeting lean much significantly towards namecalling akhilesh us quirky lucknowi style sarcasm humour rhyme political attack politician akhilesh adept metaphor turn phrase short language style central public outreach akhilesh yadav result almost unnoticed akhilesh emerged key oppositional voice twittersphere biggest beneficiary online confrontation remains rahul gandhi whose reach virality skyrocketed since winter 2017 three significant finding emerge temporal analysis gandhis tweet first rahul consistently get reply tweet politician tend detractor short message viral also much aggressive countering message direct reply,0
"According to Cook, the world has seen approximately 100 new data protection laws being put into practice in the last year or so. And, for many of these countries, these are first-time laws.

This means data protection is becoming a part of normal business for any organization. It has become an integral component of strategy and business,"" Cook said.

According to the same NYT news report, several insurance providers in US have tried to use war exemption to avoid claims related to cyberattacks.

"The US, for its part, worries that the spread of Chinese technology and ideology in Southeast Asia means Beijing will increasingly push a strategically vital region toward authoritarianism, even as individual countries grow wary of becoming beholden to China. The spread of a Chinese-style internet is a problem for U.S. internet giants from Facebook to Google wrestling with increasingly draconian regulations over what they carry on their platforms, and how they store and handle the information pivotal to their dominance. Fragmented laws governing data are anathema to giant corporations used to harnessing the cloud for everything from search to video.


If authorities in the region can convince Silicon Valley to play by their repressive rules, were going to see a drop in standards of privacy, surveillance, and freedom of expression on those platforms,"" said Tanya OCarroll, head of technology and human rights at Amnesty International. How Silicon Valley chooses to engage with the likes of Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia could set major precedents. They must not treat those countries as testbeds to tinker with peoples rights online.""


For now, U.S. social media is popular enough that in countries like Thailand theyre able to publicly resist attempts to rein in content. But in the longer term, theres a real risk American companies could get supplanted by the likes of WeChat, TikTok and Alipay -- Chinese powerhouses that are venturing aggressively abroad, into music and social media or e-commerce. Tencent, Alibaba and Bytedance Ltd. are also seeding the regions startups, courting a younger mobile-savvy consumer -- a generation that politicians need to maintain their grip on power.

"Facebook has been the target of probes by various governments after news broke about a year ago that it allowed the personal data of tens of millions of users to be shared with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. Earlier this month, it came under fire for taking too long to take down a live video of a shooting in New Zealand and allowing it to be circulated across the internet. Millions of users also had personal information accessed via a recent breach.


Over the past year, lawmakers have focused greater scrutiny on the company and its immense influence, asking its executives -- including Zuckerberg -- to testify in front of Congress to explain the proliferation of misinformation, hate speech and election manipulation on the platform.


In his post, Zuckerberg proposes that 'regulation could set baselines for whats prohibited and require companies to build systems for keeping harmful content to a bare minimum.' The tech industry has long said that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act is vital to its ability to operate open platforms. The provision exempts companies from being liable for user-generated content.


Facebook built a content-scanning system that over the years has added rules based on reactions to changes in user behavior or public uproar after an incident such as the New Zealand mass shooting. Last week, the company moved to ban content that references white nationalism or white separatism from the platform.


When the websites users or computer systems report posts as problematic, theyre sent to one of the companys 15,000 content moderators around the world, who are allowed to take content down only if it violates a rule.",facebook target probe various government news broke year ago allowed personal data ten million user shared political consultancy cambridge analytica earlier month came fire taking long take live video shooting new zealand allowing circulated across internet million user also personal information accessed via recent breach past year lawmaker focused greater scrutiny company immense influence asking executive including zuckerberg testify front congress explain proliferation misinformation hate speech election manipulation platform post zuckerberg proposes regulation could set baseline whats prohibited require company build system keeping harmful content bare minimum tech industry long said section 230 communication decency act vital ability operate open platform provision exempts company liable usergenerated content facebook built contentscanning system year added rule based reaction change user behavior public uproar incident new zealand mass shooting last week company moved ban content reference white nationalism white separatism platform websites user computer system report post problematic theyre sent one companys 15000 content moderator around world allowed take content violates rule,1

"But there are plenty of obstacles. Facebook has weathered more than two years of turbulence for repeated privacy lapses, spreading disinformation, allowing Russian agents to conduct targeted propaganda campaigns and a rising tide of hate speech and abuse.


Zuckerberg submitted to two days of grilling on Capitol Hill last April. All that increases the challenge of convincing users that Facebook really means it about privacy this time.


Encrypted conversations could alleviate some of those problems, but it could make others worse. Security is an ""admirable goal,"" said Forrester Research analyst Fatemeh Khatibloo.


""I'm just not sure it addresses the bigger issues Facebook is facing right now."" Facebook grew into a colossus by vacuuming up peoples' information in every possible way and dissecting it to shoot targeted ads back at them.

"The survey results suggest that the millennial voter who wants a leaner state is an endangered species, even in urban India. The YouGov-Mint Millennial Survey was conducted onlineamong 5,038 respondents from YouGov Indias panel of internet users spread across more than 180 cities. As many as 2,709 of the 5,038 respondents were millennials (with 1,489 younger millennials), 1,188 were from the Gen-Z (born after 1996).


Of the remaining 1,141, nearly three-fourths belonged to the Gen-X (born between 1965 and 1981) and the rest were older. Millennials and post-millennial adults together account for roughly half of Indias electorate, with an estimated population, based on census projections, of 459 million in 2019.


Millennials or post-millennials are as likely to support or oppose reservations in jobs as the older lot. In fact, a slightly greater proportion of the older lot (42%) said that reservations should be abolished compared to millennials and post-millennials (37%). A similar proportion (38%) of millennials and a slightly higher proportion of Gen Zers (42%) think that reservations should be based on economic criteria rather than caste.


Again, there is not much difference across party affiliations on these issues. There are some key issues on which there are differences between those who support the BJP and those who dont.

"The income earned by a REITs or InVIT is taxed in the form in which it is received. For example, if a REIT receives rental income, it is taxed as income from house property. Similarly, interest income of a REIT is taxed as interest income (under income from other sources).


Earlier, retail investors were only able to take exposure to these products indirectly through vehicles like mutual funds and National Pension System (NPS). Mutual funds, typically, permit exposure up to 10% to REITs and InVITs (see graph).

Its got everything a smartphone requiresan HDR10 compliant 6.4-inch QHD+ display, the top processor from Qualcomm, a premium build and finish and even that boombox loudspeaker. To add the cherry on top of that glassy cake, you have a triple camera setup.


The camera module consists of a 12MP sensor with a 27mm lens, another 12MP sensor with a telephoto 52mm lens capable of providing 2x optical zoom and finally a 16MP sensor with a 16mm ultra-wide lens. The cameras are optically and electronically stabilised.


The front of the smart also gets two camerasan 8MP sensor with a standard lens and a 5MP sensor with a 21mm wide-angle lens.


The smartphone runs Android Oreo 8.1 with a near stock Android UI and is backed by a 3,300mAh battery.

"Bhubaneswar: Facing certain amount of anti-incumbency after 19 years of power, Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik is adopting innovative campaigns this election season to reach out to youth and build a conscious narrative that he is still the credible face for 4.5 crore Odias.


After a fitness video to quell the doubt over his ill-health, Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik has now come out with micro videos where he is interacting with youth of the state and discussing how the central government is not giving the state its due on coal royalty and neglecting it on railway connection.


He is heard telling that seven of the 30 districts of Odisha still do not have rail connection despite Railway earning nearly ?20,000 crore revenue from the state and the centre has been neglecting the coastal state. Guess how much of that (Rs. 20,000 crore) is invested in Odishathey spend Rs.1000 crore. After BJP came to power, they have increased it to just 1100 crore. Odisha is the most neglected state. Even after 72 years of independence, still seven of our districts are not connected by the railways. Injustice to Odisha is injustice to our youth and their future,"" he says.",bhubaneswar facing certain amount antiincumbency 19 year power odisha chief minister naveen patnaik adopting innovative campaign election season reach youth build conscious narrative still credible face 45 crore odias fitness video quell doubt illhealth odisha chief minister naveen patnaik come micro video interacting youth state discussing central government giving state due coal royalty neglecting railway connection heard telling seven 30 district odisha still rail connection despite railway earning nearly 20000 crore revenue state centre neglecting coastal state guess much r 20000 crore invested odisha spend rs1000 crore bjp came power increased 1100 crore odisha neglected state even 72 year independence still seven district connected railway injustice odisha injustice youth future say,0

"For example lets take roadsearlier roads were constructed, but in the last five years, the constructuion of roads has doubled.


Similarly, the work in railways has doubled, electrification of rail routes has gone up three times. Has all this been possible without employment?


Today, our country has received the maximum foreign investment. GDP has remained stable, inflation too has come down. Our government has given loans to 170 million people without any bank gurantees. Of these people, 42.5 million are those who have taken loans for the first time. Considering that they have taken loans, they must have started some work with the money also. In the last five years, six lakh new professionals have joined the economy. These professionals must have employed some people. Is this not employment generation?


New vehicles have come to this country, so jobs for mechanics and drivers too must have been generated. According to a CII report, 60 million people have got jobs in medium and small enterprises. In the last 2-3 years, 5.5 million new people have enrolled for the government pension scheme.


All this data suggests that compared to previous years, employment has risen in the country. Even during the (Atal) Vajpayee governments time, the Congress ecosystem spread slogans that there was no employment.


During the Vajpayee government, 60 million people got employment, while successive governments could generate employment for only 12.5 million people.


There are three aspects to the employment questionformal employment, informal employment and symbolic (employment). Lets looks at formal employment. According to EPFO and ESIC data, we have created one million jobs every month and 12 million jobs every year. In the last four years, 5.5 million new subscribers have joined NPS (National Pension System). Approximately 10 million people are benefitting from employment generation programmes.


NASSCOM report also shows that employment in the IT sector has grown. Formal sector accounts for 15% of the total employment.


Now, lets look at the informal sector, which accounts for 85% of the employment in the country. In the last four years, 170 million people have been given loans. A CII survey shows that in the last four years, 60 million new jobs were created in the MSME sector. In the last four years, tourists and tourism in our country has grown by 50%. Dont you think that this would have generated new jobs in this sector?


Lakhs of Jan Seva Kendra are functioning across the country, dont you think employment must have been generated here?


For the past many years, India has been the fastest growing economy. If we were to compare governments after 1991, it transpires that the average growth has been the highest during our government. Is all this possible without employment generation?


International reports suggest poverty has reduced drastically. Is this possible without employment generation? Foreign investment too has touched a record high. Is this possible without employment?


India has become one of (the) biggest startup hubs globally. Development of many app-based services has contributed to our startup economy. Is this possible without employment? West Bengal, Karnataka, Odisha governments claim to have created new jobs. Is is possible that states are generating employment but the centre is not?


People who make these allegations have done great harm to the country. We have followed the same system, same arrangements and same methodology which have been followed by previous governments. Just because the results now are better, questions are being asked about the processes followed, and the integrity of institutions are questioned.


If you lose an election, EVMs are blamed. If judgments are not to your liking, impeachment proceedings are initiated against the Chief justice of India. If the media does not report according to your liking, you call it sold out.


IMF and World Bank have accepted Indias growth story. The world believes that India is the fastest growing economy. If Modi has to be opposed, oppose him, but in the zeal to oppose Modi dont attack and devalue institutions and India globally.


These days it is seen that abusive language has crept into electoral politics. Are political leaders at the top making efforts to deal with it?


I dont believe that this thing has happened overnight. Earlier, news used to come 24 hours after the event and there was little space for reporting such developments.


Once, while campaigning in Gujarat, I said that a cat had crossed my path. Next day, newspapers reported that Modi called Sonia Gandhi a cat. What do you say to such a thing?


Just look at the language of the people who give lessons on use of graceful language. Look at the kind of reports media files when the parliament is in session. They call the house a battlefield. What will you say to comments of Sonia Gandhi who called Atal Bihari Vajpayee a traitor and Modi a Maut ka Sudagaar (merchant of death). Its not that we havent faced the brunt of abusive language, but these days it's become fashionable to twist comments and give lessons on use of courteous language.


The BJP organized a big rally in West Bengal and the state is seen as the BJPs new laboratory. How successful will you be in Bengal?


Its not correct to say that the BJP sees Bengal as its new laboratory. Since 2013, I have maintained that in the absence of balanced regional development, India has suffered the most. From Punjab to Kerala, India has remained economically vibrant.


Despite the eastern part of the country being the most resource-rich region, it has lagged. This part of the country has produced the largest number of intellectuals, IAS and IPS officers. Its been my belief that for the balanced development of the country, we have to make the eastern region strong by creating infrastructure and making investments. My task for the next five years is to make the eastern part of India economically strong.


Of the developed Indias image that I have in mind, the eastern region is a part of it and not a part of some politics. Someone might say that I went to Arunachal Pradesh twice, and may see politics in it. But my government has a different take on the development of the northeastern part of the country. Every 15 days, one or the other minister from my government visits the northeastern region of the country and spends time there.


Earlier, chief ministers from the northeastern states used to camp in Delhi and still not get time to meet ministers. I have changed all of this.


Similarly, I believe that West Bengal can become the epicentre of the development story in the eastern region. I want Kolkata to enjoy the same status as Chennai, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad in the economic sphere.",example lets take roadsearlier road constructed last five year constructuion road doubled similarly work railway doubled electrification rail route gone three time possible without employment today country received maximum foreign investment gdp remained stable inflation come government given loan 170 million people without bank gurantees people 425 million taken loan first time considering taken loan must started work money also last five year six lakh new professional joined economy professional must employed people employment generation new vehicle come country job mechanic driver must generated according cii report 60 million people got job medium small enterprise last 23 year 55 million new people enrolled government pension scheme data suggests compared previous year employment risen country even atal vajpayee governments time congress ecosystem spread slogan employment vajpayee government 60 million people got employment successive government could generate employment 125 million people three aspect employment questionformal employment informal employment symbolic employment lets look formal employment according epfo esic data created one million job every month 12 million job every year last four year 55 million new subscriber joined np national pension system approximately 10 million people benefitting employment generation programme nasscom report also show employment sector grown formal sector account 15 total employment lets look informal sector account 85 employment country last four year 170 million people given loan cii survey show last four year 60 million new job created msme sector last four year tourist tourism country grown 50 dont think would generated new job sector lakh jan seva kendra functioning across country dont think employment must generated past many year india fastest growing economy compare government 1991 transpires average growth highest government possible without employment generation international report suggest poverty reduced drastically possible without employment generation foreign investment touched record high possible without employment india become one biggest startup hub globally development many appbased service contributed startup economy possible without employment west bengal karnataka odisha government claim created new job possible state generating employment centre people make allegation done great harm country followed system arrangement methodology followed previous government result better question asked process followed integrity institution questioned lose election evms blamed judgment liking impeachment proceeding initiated chief justice india medium report according liking call sold imf world bank accepted indias growth story world belief india fastest growing economy modi opposed oppose zeal oppose modi dont attack devalue institution india globally day seen abusive language crept electoral politics political leader top making effort deal dont believe thing happened overnight earlier news used come 24 hour event little space reporting development campaigning gujarat said cat crossed path next day newspaper reported modi called sonia gandhi cat say thing look language people give lesson use graceful language look kind report medium file parliament session call house battlefield say comment sonia gandhi called atal bihari vajpayee traitor modi maut ka sudagaar merchant death its havent faced brunt abusive language day become fashionable twist comment give lesson use courteous language bjp organized big rally west bengal state seen bjps new laboratory successful bengal its correct say bjp see bengal new laboratory since 2013 maintained absence balanced regional development india suffered punjab kerala india remained economically vibrant despite eastern part country resourcerich region lagged part country produced largest number intellectual ia ip officer its belief balanced development country make eastern region strong creating infrastructure making investment task next five year make eastern part india economically strong developed indias image mind eastern region part part politics someone might say went arunachal pradesh twice may see politics government different take development northeastern part country every 15 day one minister government visit northeastern region country spends time earlier chief minister northeastern state used camp delhi still get time meet minister changed similarly believe west bengal become epicentre development story eastern region want kolkata enjoy status chennai mumbai bengaluru hyderabad economic sphere,0

"One of the aspirations that the Indian government has stated is that they want 40% of the service provision around AI to be delivered by Indian companies over the next few years. India is investing hugely in data warehousing. Therefore, we want to see some of the UKs leading companies linking with leading Indian companies to develop AI technology with a certain type of protocol. For instance, British Telecom has a very large capability in developing AI. And here in India, Infosys Ltd too has a similar capability. You can quite easily see both these companies working together on a specific project which would allow data to be easily available to allow AI to be created.


With regard to data sharing agreement between India and the UK, a critical part would be the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Indian Data Protection Bill. How would you achieve parity when GDPR is more advanced and more specific than the Indian law?

The leather industry was once a key source of employment in Kanpur and the neighbouring area of Unnao. But the BJP-led state government ordered the closure of the tanneries in December. The directive, issued ahead of the Kumbh mela, was in line with the central governments mission to clean Ganga.


The tanneries were the main source of income. Each tannery employed 100-150 people who have now been left without jobs.

However, Kuo believes that the Cupertino, California-based company could still use LCP as the primary material for 5G antennas in 2020 iPhones.",part upcoming iphones apple plan using modifiedpi magnetic particle inspection mpi material instead using liquid crystal polymer lcp material used antenna iphones x x max xr according kuo lcp limit radio frequency rf performance handset due technology limitation production issue cnet reported sunday however kuo belief cupertino californiabased company could still use lcp primary material 5g antenna 2020 iphones,1

"Espresso Labs aims to redefine luxury through voice with its AI-powered virtual concierge by building applications for smart speakers like Google Home and Amazons Alexa, which can be used as a concierge in a hotel room"". Guests can simply talk to the device in their native language and the device will understand, translate and also automatically notify the staff,"" says co-founder Pallavi Gupta. Her company is currently running pilots with hotels in the Delhi-NCR including hotel chains like Hyatt Regency and Roseate House.


A luxury hotel, on average, gets more than 1,000 guest requests per day and all these requests are noted, logged and assigned manually, explains Gupta. This error prone process results in hotel staff missing out on 6% of service requests daily leading to a negative guest experience. Espressos suite of applications include Android, desktop and iOS apps and a complaint management software.

After all, by their own forecast, headline inflation is likely to remain below the 4% target for two consecutive years now.


The central bank knows this is the right time to give a hand to manufacturers, by bringing down their cost of borrowing, thus giving a boost to economic growth. For this, RBI has brought its repo rate down by 25 basis points and governor Shaktikanta Das said that banks need to do more to pass on these rate cuts.

"A Mint analysis of the NFHS data shows that households with internet access are concentrated in the prosperous North Indian belt spanning Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Chandigarh and Delhi. Jammu and Kashmir, Mizoram and Nagaland also reported high internet access, but the sample sizes for these states are relatively small.


The NFHS surveyed more than 600,000 households across the country in 2015-16. It is a rich source of data on household ownership of assets and amenities, though the database is primarily used to assess health outcomes. The telecom regulator provides some disaggregated data on internet connectivity for more recent years, but that data is skewed because of multiple internet connections in the same household. The NFHS data are thus the latest estimates of actual internet penetration from an official and large-scale, nationally representative survey.


A disaggregated district-level analysis shows that in 123 of the 640 districts from where data was collected, at least one-fifth of the population had household access to internet. In 50 districts, at least one-third of the population had household access to internet. It is in these districts that the internet battle for hearts and minds will be the fiercest.

"Intel and Samsung have supported the FTC in friend-of-the-court filings, arguing Qualcomms defense is outdated since its years of dominance through innovation and hard work"" have been replaced with monopolistic practices. Those practices suppress competition and harm consumers,"" Intel said in a May 2017 filing.


The FTC case and Apples rapid follow-up caused a selloff in Qualcomms stock on concern that its ability to charge for patents was under threat. That in turn led to a hostile takeover bid by Broadcom Inc. that was thwarted by the US government on national security grounds.


A key issue in the FTC case is how Qualcomm gets paid for licensing its technology. The company owns the invention by which multiple data streams can use the same set of radio frequencies.


None of its opponents deny that Qualcomm came up with innovative technology that is key to industry standards. They challenge the extent to which Qualcomm uses its patents on those inventions to extract fees. Currently the company gets paid a percentage of the total selling price of each phone sold. Even amid non payments and disputes, that revenue totaled $5.2 billion in its most recent financial year.


Qualcomms adversaries claim thats unfair because theres so much other technology that makes a phone attractive and useful to consumers that comes from elsewhere. They argue the company should set fees based on the price of the component that uses its technology. Thats a drop to the low tens of dollars from a basis in the hundreds of dollars.

So can we tell amazing stories in the form of chat messages?"" Thus Plop started in early 2018 along with co-founder Vineet Shetty.


We currently use many of the mobile phones native features like vibration, and backlights to add special effects to the stories.

"Amazon isnt the only company that periodically gets caught up in cases of private records mistakenly made public


Facebook shared this kind of information freely with third-party developers for years, before cracking down more recently


Researchers at UpGuard, a cybersecurity firm, found troves of user information hiding in plain sight, inadvertently posted publicly on Amazon.com Inc.s cloud computing servers. The discovery shows that a year after the Cambridge Analytica scandal exposed how unsecure and widely disseminated Facebook users information is online, companies that control that information at every step still havent done enough to seal up private data.


In one instance, Mexico City-based digital platform Cultura Colectiva, openly stored 540 million records on Facebook users, including identification numbers, comments, reactions and account names. The records were accessible and downloadable for anyone who could find them online. That database was closed on Wednesday after Bloomberg alerted Facebook to the problem and Facebook contacted Amazon. Facebook shares pared their gains after the Bloomberg News report.

In March, Google asked the FCC to allow its short-range interactive motion sensing Soli radar to operate in the 57- to 64-GHz frequency band at power levels consistent with European Telecommunications Standards Institute standards. Facebook Inc raised concerns with the FCC that the Soli sensors operating in the spectrum band at higher power levels might have issues coexisting with other technologies.

"Rao, one of the biggest proponents of a non-BJP, non-Congress front, has indicated that he would probably join the Modi-led National Democratic Alliance. Such an alliance risks alienating and losing the support of Asaduddin Owaisi led All India Majilis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, which influences minority votes in Hyderabad and other parts of the state.


With the bifurcation of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh in 2014, the Congress had expected to retain power in the former state in 2014 when assembly and Lok Sabha elections were held simultaneously in the two Telugu states. However, the polls witnessed the rise of the TRS, while the N. Chandrababu Naidu-led Telugu Desam Party won in Andhra Pradesh.


The Congress won 21 assembly and two Lok Sabha seats in 2014, but was completely wiped out in AP, failing to win even a single seat in either the Lok Sabha or the assembly and getting less than 5% of the votes. The loss was mainly attributed to the Congress being blamed for dividing the state by citizens.


Five years later, the scenario has become worse for the TDP in Andhra Pradesh, with the rise of the YSRCP. Hit with anti-incumbency, Naidus political future is perhaps at stake, as he is also leading the anti-BJP coalition with the Congress at the national level.

"The extended reach of the ban might affect the legal analysis of whether this is an overly broad measure to address a perceived security risk,"" said Robert D. Williams, a Senior Research Scholar and Lecturer in Law and the Executive Director of the Paul Tsai China Center at Yale Law School.


This is a very steep hill for Huawei to climb,"" Williams said. The question is whether the law is punitive or preventative  was Congress trying to punish the company or prevent a risk? The government doesnt have to demonstrate that this is the most narrowly tailored solution it could have chosen. And courts, generally speaking, are deferential to Congress and the president on matters of national security.""


American officials have long been concerned about the risk of using Huawei equipment. A 2012 report by the House Intelligence Committee urged US businesses to avoid the Chinese companys products and called for blocking all mergers and acquisitions involving them.


In January, after unveiling indictments against Huawei and its chief financial officer, FBI Director Christopher Wray outlined the potential risk of growing too dependent upon foreign technology.


These cases make clear that as a country, we have to carefully consider the risks that companies like Huawei pose if were going to allow them into our telecommunications infrastructure,"" Wray said. That kind of access could give a foreign government the capacity to maliciously modify or steal information, to conduct undetected espionage, or to exert pressure or control.""",extended reach ban might affect legal analysis whether overly broad measure address perceived security risk said robert williams senior research scholar lecturer law executive director paul tsai china center yale law school this steep hill huawei climb williams said the question whether law punitive preventative  congress trying punish company prevent risk government doesnt demonstrate narrowly tailored solution could chosen court generally speaking deferential congress president matter national security american official long concerned risk using huawei equipment 2012 report house intelligence committee urged u business avoid chinese companys product called blocking merger acquisition involving january unveiling indictment huawei chief financial officer fbi director christopher wray outlined potential risk growing dependent upon foreign technology these case make clear country carefully consider risk company like huawei pose were going allow telecommunication infrastructure wray said that kind access could give foreign government capacity maliciously modify steal information conduct undetected espionage exert pressure control,1

"The Samsung Galaxy Fold phone is shown on a screen at Samsung's Unpacked event in San Francisco. (AFP)


Its hard to imagine how smartphones could get much better. Most are already zippy and equipped with jumbo screens, powerful cameras and face scanners. So what else can we look forward to?


It turns out, plenty. For a peek at the future of the phone, look to Samsung, the worlds largest handset-maker. On Wednesday, the South Korean company showed off a family of four new Galaxy phones that incorporate new technologies and features that may start spreading to other smartphones.


Of the four new devices, one will work on next-generation ultrafast 5G cellular networks, which means it can download a movie in seconds rather than minutes. Three of the models will have slightly larger screens and more complex camera systems than their predecessors.


And Samsung is also teasing a fifth device that can be folded and unfolded like a book to decrease or increase the phones screen size to suit its owner (though its unclear whether this gadget will go on sale this year).


Theres a lot to unpack here. Heres what you need to know about whats coming with screen sizes, cameras, 5G and the elusive foldable phone.


Many phone-makers, including Samsung, Apple and Google, have focused on making screens larger without adding bulk to their bodies. To do this, they stretched the screens from one edge to another while shrinking the bezels, or the borders surrounding the screen.


Samsung is continuing this trend. Its new Galaxy S10 and S10 Plus phones have 6.1-inch and 6.4-inch displays, up from the 5.8-inch and 6.2-inch screens on last years Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus. Even though the screens are bigger, Samsung said, the devices body sizes are more compact than their predecessors.",samsung galaxy fold phone shown screen samsungs unpacked event san francisco afp its hard imagine smartphones could get much better already zippy equipped jumbo screen powerful camera face scanner else look forward turn plenty peek future phone look samsung worlds largest handsetmaker wednesday south korean company showed family four new galaxy phone incorporate new technology feature may start spreading smartphones four new device one work nextgeneration ultrafast 5g cellular network mean download movie second rather minute three model slightly larger screen complex camera system predecessor samsung also teasing fifth device folded unfolded like book decrease increase phones screen size suit owner though its unclear whether gadget go sale year theres lot unpack heres need know whats coming screen size camera 5g elusive foldable phone many phonemakers including samsung apple google focused making screen larger without adding bulk body stretched screen one edge another shrinking bezel border surrounding screen samsung continuing trend new galaxy s10 s10 plus phone 61inch 64inch display 58inch 62inch screen last years galaxy s9 s9 plus even though screen bigger samsung said devices body size compact predecessor,1

"At least four major leaders of the BJP want to contest from the seatthe party chief Pillai, union minister of state for tourism Alphons Kannanthanam, BJP general secretaries K Surendran and MT Ramesh who are not willing to contest from anywhere else.


Pillai has been making a pitch to contest from Pathanamthitta early on, taking credit for the Sabarimala fight and highlighting his rapport with upper caste Hindu organisation Nair Service Society, according to a BJP leader who declined to be named. But Pillai's flip-flops during the Sabarimala campaign received him backlash from the two major factions in Kerala BJP, who have been lobbying for their loyalists for the Pathanamthitta seat. One faction led by V. Muraleedharan has been pushing for Surendran and the other led by P.K. Krishna Das have been pushing for MT Ramesh, said the leader.


Ramesh has previously said he did not wish to contest the polls if not picked for Pathanamthitta. While Surendran initially wanted to contest from Thrissur constituency, the seat is expected to be given to ally Bharat Dharma Jana Sena (BDJS), as its leader Thushar Vellappally showed interest to contest.

"Once you have got that sorted out, take a look at the power output. A 100-watt setup is an overkill for an apartment; a 10-watt setup is measly when you have Rob Bourdon on the drums. A 15-20 watt setup might be sufficient for most beginners and intermediate guitar players.


Then take a look at other optionspre-amp or gain, overdrive and gimmicks like an in-built BOSS pedal. See the dynamic range of the speakers. Play around with the EQ knobs. If youre playing solos youd require a good mid response, if youre playing rhythm, youd require great highs and lows. To really get the idea of how an amp sounds, its advisable you go to a guitar store and listen to it yourself.


Its always advisable to get a separate pedal for getting creative with your tone and not rely solely on your amp.


Good beginner amp options include Fender Champion (20W), Roland Cube 20GX and Ibanez IBZ10G V2 (10W).


A stomp pedal or an effects pedal is a foot switch connected between your guitar and amplifier to provide more tonal creativity. Try listening to any Hendrix song played on an electric guitarthats a sound made by an effects pedal.


The types of effects are a function a pedal makers creativity (read craziness)there are pedals that make different notes of a guitar sound like the notes in Super Marios intro track. Needless to say, the most popular are the less tacky ones. To begin with, you can choose from overdrive (mimicking the loudest volume on a valve amp), fuzz (listen it out here), reverb (repeating a note again and again every few milliseconds), loop (repeats a phrase you play until you turn it off) and Wah"" (creates a wah"" sound when the pedal is depressed).

"Whether thats a privacy concern or not depends on how cautious Amazon and other companies are in what type of information they have manually annotated, and how they present that information to someone,"" he added.


When the Echo debuted in 2014, Amazons cylindrical smart speaker quickly popularized the use of voice software in the home. Before long, Alphabet Inc. launched its own version, called Google Home, followed by Apple Inc.s HomePod. Various companies also sell their own devices in China. Globally, consumers bought 78 million smart speakers last year, according to researcher Canalys. Millions more use voice software to interact with digital assistants on their smartphones.


Alexa software is designed to continuously record snatches of audio, listening for a wake word. Thats Alexa"" by default, but people can change it to Echo"" or computer."" When the wake word is detected, the light ring at the top of the Echo turns blue, indicating the device is recording and beaming a command to Amazon servers.


Most modern speech-recognition systems rely on neural networks patterned on the human brain. The software learns as it goes, by spotting patterns amid vast amounts of data. The algorithms powering the Echo and other smart speakers use models of probability to make educated guesses. If someone asks Alexa if theres a Greek place nearby, the algorithms know the user is probably looking for a restaurant, not a church or community center.


But sometimes Alexa gets it wrongespecially when grappling with new slang, regional colloquialisms or languages other than English. In French, avec sa, with him"" or with her,"" can confuse the software into thinking someone is using the Alexa wake word. Hecho, Spanish for a fact or deed, is sometimes misinterpreted as Echo. And so on. Thats why Amazon recruited human helpers to fill in the gaps missed by the algorithms.


Apples Siri also has human helpers, who work to gauge whether the digital assistants interpretation of requests lines up with what the person said. The recordings they review lack personally identifiable information and are stored for six months tied to a random identifier, according to an Apple security white paper. After that, the data is stripped of its random identification information but may be stored for longer periods to improve Siris voice recognition.


At Google, some employees can access some audio snippets from its Assistant to help train and improve the product, but its not associated with any personally identifiable information and the audio is distorted, the company says.

"The Chinese smartphone manufacturer today introduced the Redmi Note 6 Pro in the Indian market, the successor to the Note 5 Pro, pricing it at ? 13,999 for the base variant. Boasting an additional camera on the front housed inside a notched display, the Note 6 Pro has a few subtle tweaks here and there, but its very strong to its roots.


Keeping everyone busy with the buzz about the Note 6 Pro, Xiaomi silently killed the successor to its sub-Rs 10,000 champ. The Note 5 featured a Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor with up to 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. A 5.99-inch display lit up the front of the phone along with a lonesome 5MP selfie camera. The rear of the phone sported a single 12MP camera with f/2.2 aperture. There was no word from Xiaomi on the successor to this phone.


Lets superimpose the specifications of another similarly priced smartphone from Xiaomi, the Redmi 6 Pro. Its got the same underpinnings, and costs just a thousand rupees more the Note 5. It has a slightly different display, measuring 5.84-inches diagonally with a notch. Some purists may argue thats a reasonable decrease, but if you squint harder, Xiaomi has cleverly kept the same length but a shrunk down the width of the display.

"And, as the two researchers showed, a neural network can learn to write phishing messages by inspecting tweets, Reddit posts and previous online hacks.


Today, the same mathematical technique is infusing machines with a wide range of humanlike powers, from speech recognition to language translation. In many cases, this new breed of artificial intelligence is also an ideal means of deceiving large numbers of people over the internet. Mass manipulation is about to get a whole lot easier.


It would be very surprising if things dont go this way,"" said Shahar Avin, a researcher at the Center for the Study of Existential Risk at the University of Cambridge. All the trends point in that direction.""


Many technology observers have expressed concerns at the rise of AI that generates Deepfakes  fake images that look like the real thing. What began as a way of putting anyones head onto the shoulders of a porn star has evolved into a tool for seamlessly putting any image or audio into any video.


In April, BuzzFeed and comedian Jordan Peele released a video that put words, including we need to be more vigilant with what we trust from the internet,"" into the mouth of Barack Obama.


The threat will only expand as researchers develop systems that can metabolize and learn from increasingly large collections of data. Neural networks can generate believable sounds as well as images. This is what enables digital assistants such as Apple Siri to sound more human than they did in years past.


Google has built a system called Duplex that can phone a local restaurant, make reservations, and fool the person on the other end of the line into thinking the caller is a real person. The service is expected to reach smartphones before the end of the year.


Experts have long had the power to doctor audio and video. But as these AI systems improve, it will become easier and cheaper for anyone to generate items of digital content  images, videos, social interactions  that look and sound like the real thing.


Inspired by the culture of academia, the top AI labs and even giant public companies such as Google openly publish their research and, in many cases, their software code.",two researcher showed neural network learn write phishing message inspecting tweet reddit post previous online hack today mathematical technique infusing machine wide range humanlike power speech recognition language translation many case new breed artificial intelligence also ideal mean deceiving large number people internet mass manipulation get whole lot easier it would surprising thing dont go way said shahar avin researcher center study existential risk university cambridge all trend point direction many technology observer expressed concern rise ai generates deepfakes  fake image look like real thing began way putting anyones head onto shoulder porn star evolved tool seamlessly putting image audio video april buzzfeed comedian jordan peele released video put word including we need vigilant trust internet mouth barack obama threat expand researcher develop system metabolize learn increasingly large collection data neural network generate believable sound well image enables digital assistant apple siri sound human year past google built system called duplex phone local restaurant make reservation fool person end line thinking caller real person service expected reach smartphones end year expert long power doctor audio video ai system improve become easier cheaper anyone generate item digital content  image video social interaction  look sound like real thing inspired culture academia top ai lab even giant public company google openly publish research many case software code,1

"To define style"" for the study, the Dartmouth researchers reference sentence length, the use of passive or active voices and word choice that could result in texts with varying degrees of simplicity or formality. The team used 34 stylistically distinct Bible versions ranging in linguistic complexity from the King James Version"" to the Bible in Basic English"". The texts were fed into two algorithmsa statistical machine translation system called Moses"" and a neural network framework commonly used in machine translation, Seq2Seq"". Neural networks are algorithms modelled on the human brain.


While different versions of the Bible were used to train the computer code, systems could ultimately be developed that translate the style of any written text for different audiences. As an example, a style translator could take an English-language selection from Moby Dick and translate it into different versions suitable for young readers, non-native English speakers, or any one of a variety of audiences, according to the researchers.

"A Congress official said the BJP had the funds to reserve most of India's fleet of helicopters for hire for 90 days, making it difficult for opponents to get hold of them.


""We have never ever seen an election with such disparity. Financially, we cannot compete with them,"" said another veteran Congress politician, who asked to remain anonymous.


He and another high-ranking Congress official said they expected the BJP to outspend them by a factor of ten. A third Congress source estimated the disparity at twice that.


Two BJP officials declined to provide an estimate of spending, but one said the ""BJP definitely has a big war chest and has more funds at its disposal than the Congress.""


Congress has received far fewer funds because of a perception it is unlikely to win the election, political strategists said. The opposition party has been hampered by its inability to forge a national alliance to take on Modi and has struggled to capitalise on discontent against the BJP over a lack of jobs and distressed farm incomes.


Modi has been topping polls as India's most popular politician, well ahead of Congress President Rahul Gandhi.


Money has become critical in elections given the country's 1.3 billion population, its voting over 39 days and the sheer complexity of the electorate, in terms of region, religion, language, and caste.


A tradition of doling out freebies to sway voters only adds to costs. Authorities say they have seized goods and cash worth about $456 million since March 26.

Googles forecasting system is based on a scalable high resolution hydraulic model which, according to Nevo, can simulate the behaviour of water across the floodplain more accurately. The model helps in understanding how much water is going to be within a river system and exactly where it will flow. Existing forecasting systems that are modelled on the widely-used elevation data sets, like the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), often miss details of the topography resulting in water overflowing everywhere and spilling throughout the whole map, argued Nevo.

"Security researchers have long warned that misuse of enterprise developer certificates, which act as digital keys that tell an iPhone a piece of software downloaded from the internet can be trusted and opened. They are the centerpiece of Apple's program for corporate apps and enable consumers to install apps onto iPhones without Apple's knowledge.


Apple last month briefly banned Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc from using enterprise certificates after they used them to distribute data-gathering apps to consumers.


The distributors of pirated apps seen by Reuters are using certificates obtained in the name of legitimate businesses, although it is unclear how. Several pirates have impersonated a subsidiary of China Mobile Ltd. China Mobile did not respond to requests for comment.


Tech news website TechCrunch earlier this week reported that certificate abuse also enabled the distribution of apps for pornography and gambling, both of which are banned from the App Store.


Since the App Store debuted in 2008, Apple has sought to portray the iPhone as safer than rival Android devices because Apple reviews and approves all apps distributed to the devices.


Early on, hackers ""jailbroke"" iPhones by modifying their software to evade Apple's controls, but that process voided the iPhone's warranty and scared off many casual users.

"Netflix declined to discuss its reasons for ending new subscriptions through the app store. But its move drew more attention to an app store tax that other technology companies have already attacked as an abuse of the power that Apple has amassed since opening its app store years ago.


Almost three years ago, Spotify also stopped accepting new subscriptions through Apple's app store. Its move followed the debut of Apple Music, which obviously doesn't have to pay any commissions.


""They're trying to have their cake and eat ours, too,"" Spotify spokesman Jonathan Prince told The Associated Press in 2016. ""We find it bad for consumers, unfair to consumers and ultimately something that could stifle music streaming subscriptions across the board.""


Spotify regularly harps on the unfairness of Apple's app-fee system in its securities filings. The company didn't respond to interview requests for this story.


Few other apps reach as many customers as Netflix and Spotify, making it unlikely that the rebellion against Apple's app store commissions will greatly swell, said Amir Ghodrati, director of market insights for App Annie.


Apple doesn't seem to be worried. In fact, it's reportedly demanding an even higher commission  roughly 50%  for a Netflix-like news service that it is trying to create with a variety of publishers, according to a recent Wall Street Journal report based on unidentified people familiar with the negotiations.",netflix declined discus reason ending new subscription app store move drew attention app store tax technology company already attacked abuse power apple amassed since opening app store year ago almost three year ago spotify also stopped accepting new subscription apple app store move followed debut apple music obviously doesnt pay commission theyre trying cake eat spotify spokesman jonathan prince told associated press 2016 find bad consumer unfair consumer ultimately something could stifle music streaming subscription across board spotify regularly harp unfairness apple appfee system security filing company didnt respond interview request story apps reach many customer netflix spotify making unlikely rebellion apple app store commission greatly swell said amir ghodrati director market insight app annie apple doesnt seem worried fact reportedly demanding even higher commission  roughly 50  netflixlike news service trying create variety publisher according recent wall street journal report based unidentified people familiar negotiation,1

"Modi and nationalism may work in rest of India, but in Chennai, water and basic infrastructure matter the most


Whether the candidate is a newbie or a veteran, the voter blue or white collar, across Chennai, it is local issues that dominate campaigns and conversations


CHENNAI: On a recent Sunday afternoon, about 150 residents of Old Mahabalipuram Road (OMR) in Chennais southern edge settled into plastic chairs in the basement of a building in Sholinganallurwaiting for the candidates contesting from the Chennai South constituency to show up, take questions, and give their respective stump speeches.


One group was discussing tax-saving investments, another was busy listing out new real estate projects to invest in, and a third was joking about whether the candidates will try to slip them any money, since Tamil Nadu politicians are after all masters of cash-for-vote schemes. I heard Semmancheri (a low-income neighbourhood down the road) got ?500 a house and theyre angry because the going rate this year is ?2,000,"" said a man as the others in the group chuckled.


On Tuesday night, in the frenetic final hours of campaigning, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) familys prominent New Delhi face, Kanimozhi, was caught up in the middle of an income tax raid. Nothing of substance was found and the southern state went to bed after adding a few more conspiracy theories to the long list that has been circulating in Tamil Nadu ever since the DMKs M. Karunanidhi and All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagams (AIADMKs) J. Jayalalithaa exited the political landscape.


In the Sunday afternoon circle, though, which was filled mostly with members belonging to the Federation of OMR Residents Associations (FOMRRA), cash distribution was hardly the key electoral issue. The federation is a citizens group which claims to represent close to 300,000 households in gated communities and apartment complexes that dot a posh 15-kilometre (km) stretch by the sea. They invited all the Chennai South Lok Sabha candidates, who would otherwise not be allowed into gated communities, to campaign, and most accepted. Among this group of city residents, cash-for-votes and nationalism dont sell. What matters is more mundane and every daywater and sewage lines.


If pushed to talk about larger policy issues concerning national politics, Chennai voters pick the imposition of the NEET, and GST, and centre-state relations.


OMR or the IT corridor, officially called Rajiv Gandhi Salai, is one of the newer parts of the citybuilt hurriedly in the wake of an influx of information technology (IT) firms in the early 2000s. But even the relatively rich cannot escape the egalitarian failures of haphazard urban planning. In large sections of the IT corridor, water and sewage lines have not yet been laid, and the gated communities depend on a fleet of water tankers, and have their own sewage treatment plants.",modi nationalism may work rest india chennai water basic infrastructure matter whether candidate newbie veteran voter blue white collar across chennai local issue dominate campaign conversation chennai recent sunday afternoon 150 resident old mahabalipuram road omr chennais southern edge settled plastic chair basement building sholinganallurwaiting candidate contesting chennai south constituency show take question give respective stump speech one group discussing taxsaving investment another busy listing new real estate project invest third joking whether candidate try slip money since tamil nadu politician master cashforvote scheme i heard semmancheri lowincome neighbourhood road got 500 house theyre angry going rate year 2000 said man others group chuckled tuesday night frenetic final hour campaigning dravida munnetra kazhagam dmk familys prominent new delhi face kanimozhi caught middle income tax raid nothing substance found southern state went bed adding conspiracy theory long list circulating tamil nadu ever since dmks karunanidhi india anna dravida munnetra kazhagams aiadmks j jayalalithaa exited political landscape sunday afternoon circle though filled mostly member belonging federation omr residents association fomrra cash distribution hardly key electoral issue federation citizens group claim represent close 300000 household gated community apartment complex dot posh 15kilometre km stretch sea invited chennai south lok sabha candidate would otherwise allowed gated community campaign accepted among group city resident cashforvotes nationalism dont sell matter mundane every daywater sewage line pushed talk larger policy issue concerning national politics chennai voter pick imposition neet gst centrestate relation omr corridor officially called rajiv gandhi salai one newer part citybuilt hurriedly wake influx information technology firm early 2000s even relatively rich escape egalitarian failure haphazard urban planning large section corridor water sewage line yet laid gated community depend fleet water tanker sewage treatment plant,0

"Thackeray was deep in love with Modi and the Gujarat model"" through 2013-14. However, the unalloyed bhakt has turned a ferocious antagonist, a hard-hitting challenger. Thackeray is the opposition juggernaut that Modi-Shah, Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray had not bargained for, did not prepare for when election campaigning began. By the time Thackeray winds up his caravan, he could end up changing the states political matrix.


The bhakti, he now says, was an error of judgementhe fell for Modis public relations exercise, listened to people like Ratan Tata, visited Gujarat as Modis guest, but he has since woken up to the dangers of the Modi model. Its a clever admission. It carries a subtextThackeray is telling Maharashtra that he, like many people, made a mistake in 2014 and they shouldnt repeat it now.


In his utterances, demeanour, and willingness to take on the powerful, Thackeray is now the main opposition voice in Maharashtra. He is doing the work, the campaigning, the activism, and the confrontation that the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) should have; his earlier parochialism, muscle-flexing methods, violence as political tool are forgotten in the moment. The Congress and the NCP have, in a rare import from business to politics, out-sourced their work to Thackeray.


That Thackeray, a political write-off in 2014, is now Maharashtras chief campaigner for opposition parties shows the paucity of imagination in Congress-NCP and erosion of the opposition space. In the 15 years of Congress-NCP governments till 2014, the BJP and the Shiv Sena vied with each other to be the principal opposition party. Between BJPs Eknath Khadse and Fadnavis, and Sena leaders including Bal Thackeray and his son Uddhav, they made sure that successive Congress chief ministers were kept on their toes with exposes of scams and critique of policies.


In May 2014, the Lok Sabha tally of 42 of 48 seats to the BJP-Sena coalition and the then prevalent Modi-mania made the BJP believe that it was time to end its 25-year-old alliance with the regional force. It called off the alliance with barely a month to go for the October 2014 election to the state assembly. The BJP emerged as the single largest party, with 122 seats in the 288-member assembly, but short of a majority. The Sena, battling odds, netted 63 seats. Eventually, it joined the government but it is an uncomfortable alliance.


The Sena, miffed at the treatment it received in Delhi and Mumbai in Modi-Shah-Fadnavis era, lost no opportunity to hit back, criticise and question Modi and Fadnavis. Its words were acerbic and meant to hurt the BJP, they were louder than those of Congress-NCP. Uddhav Thackeray came close to calling off the alliance a number of times but realpolitik prevailed. Through this, the Sena donned two hats at once  it was in government and it also became the opposition"".",thackeray deep love modi gujarat model 201314 however unalloyed bhakt turned ferocious antagonist hardhitting challenger thackeray opposition juggernaut modishah maharashtra chief minister devendra fadnavis shiv sena chief uddhav thackeray bargained prepare election campaigning began time thackeray wind caravan could end changing states political matrix bhakti say error judgementhe fell modis public relation exercise listened people like ratan tata visited gujarat modis guest since woken danger modi model its clever admission carry subtextthackeray telling maharashtra like many people made mistake 2014 shouldnt repeat utterance demeanour willingness take powerful thackeray main opposition voice maharashtra work campaigning activism confrontation congressnationalist congress party ncp earlier parochialism muscleflexing method violence political tool forgotten moment congress ncp rare import business politics outsourced work thackeray thackeray political writeoff 2014 maharashtras chief campaigner opposition party show paucity imagination congressncp erosion opposition space 15 year congressncp government till 2014 bjp shiv sena vied principal opposition party bjps eknath khadse fadnavis sena leader including bal thackeray son uddhav made sure successive congress chief minister kept toe expose scam critique policy may 2014 lok sabha tally 42 48 seat bjpsena coalition prevalent modimania made bjp believe time end 25yearold alliance regional force called alliance barely month go october 2014 election state assembly bjp emerged single largest party 122 seat 288member assembly short majority sena battling odds netted 63 seat eventually joined government uncomfortable alliance sena miffed treatment received delhi mumbai modishahfadnavis era lost opportunity hit back criticise question modi fadnavis word acerbic meant hurt bjp louder congressncp uddhav thackeray came close calling alliance number time realpolitik prevailed sena donned two hat  government also became opposition,0

""Our initial take is these developments are pressing down on market confidence, seen in lower bond yields and equities.""


Yields on German and French 10-year bonds dived to their lowest since 2016, while banking stocks took a beating. The euro duly sank to depths last seen in mid-2017, sending the safe-haven U.S. dollar and yen surging.


The next hurdle for investors will be US payrolls data for February, with analysts uncertain how much payback there might be for January's outsized jump. There was also a chance the jobless rate could fall by more than forecast given the recent strength in employment.


The numbers are still likely to highlight the relative outperformance of the U.S. economy, especially against the European Union, and further encourage dollar bulls.",central bank surprise like investor wonder whether infers thing much worse thought said gavin friend senior market strategist nab initial take development pressing market confidence seen lower bond yield equity yield german french 10year bond dived lowest since 2016 banking stock took beating euro duly sank depth last seen mid2017 sending safehaven u dollar yen surging next hurdle investor u payroll data february analyst uncertain much payback might january outsized jump also chance jobless rate could fall forecast given recent strength employment number still likely highlight relative outperformance u economy especially european union encourage dollar bull,3

"Our phones have become smarter, interfaces slicker, and communication faster. But other predictions havent come to pass. Illustration: Jayachandran/Mint


Less than a tenth of the 289 billion-dollar startups are working on next-gen innovations. Why has everybody dropped the ball?


long-reads mint-india-wire Big technologystartupsPeter Thielartificial intelligenceStanley Kubrick2001: A Space OdysseyAutomated assistantsSiriAlexaUberSwiggySoftbankAI


This may seem like an odd time to question the ingenuity of the technology sector. With news of artificial intelligence (A.I.), automation and machine-learning swirling around, the technology space looks like a bright spot in a dull economy. Mega venture funds and frothy startup valuations seem to bear out this optimism.


Yet, fifty years ago we imagined a very different future. Stanley Kubricks classic 2001: A Space Odyssey released during the heyday of the space program assumed that by the early part of this millennium, space travel would be routine; machines would be terrifyingly intelligent; and computers and humans would have intelligent conversation.


By that yardstick, the present is decidedly underwhelming. Our phones have become smarter, interfaces slicker, and communication faster. But other predictions havent come to pass.


Most space programs are limited to unmanned expeditions. After the lull of the past few decades, space travel is in the news again. But even Elon Musk, the eternally confident founder of Space X, expects to send a manned expedition to the moon only in 2023, the first lunar journey by humans since 1972.


Driverless vehicles are not ready to replace humans yet. The vagaries of human traffic are just too much for these ordered systems. Robots, which are used extensively in manufacturing and distribution, havent been able to adapt to routine human tasks. Automated assistants like Siri are great for one-off tasks, but its near impossible to hold a conversation, especially with a thick accent.


There are around 290 unicorns, or unlisted startups valued at more than $1 billion, across the world. In theory, these unicorns represent the best of our ideas. Investors seem to agree, ploughing over $980 billion into these companies.",phone become smarter interface slicker communication faster prediction havent come pas illustration jayachandranmint less tenth 289 billiondollar startup working nextgen innovation everybody dropped ball longreads mintindiawire big technologystartupspeter thielartificial intelligencestanley kubrick2001 space odysseyautomated assistantssirialexauberswiggysoftbankai may seem like odd time question ingenuity technology sector news artificial intelligence ai automation machinelearning swirling around technology space look like bright spot dull economy mega venture fund frothy startup valuation seem bear optimism yet fifty year ago imagined different future stanley kubricks classic 2001 space odyssey released heyday space program assumed early part millennium space travel would routine machine would terrifyingly intelligent computer human would intelligent conversation yardstick present decidedly underwhelming phone become smarter interface slicker communication faster prediction havent come pas space program limited unmanned expedition lull past decade space travel news even elon musk eternally confident founder space x expects send manned expedition moon 2023 first lunar journey human since 1972 driverless vehicle ready replace human yet vagary human traffic much ordered system robot used extensively manufacturing distribution havent able adapt routine human task automated assistant like siri great oneoff task its near impossible hold conversation especially thick accent around 290 unicorn unlisted startup valued 1 billion across world theory unicorn represent best idea investor seem agree ploughing 980 billion company,1

New Delhi: Aarati Mehta, a Delhi-based designer, was tired of going to clubs and bars for parties. Her problem was that she would typically be around the same people at these parties.


A number of people today believe that bars and clubs have outgrown their usefulness, and are looking for alternative venues for parties. Some technology platforms are trying to take advantage of that.


A friend of Mehta recommended that she explore MyScoota web-based platform that lets people find house parties in their city. The platform started about a year-and-a-half ago from a Google form that was circulated on the internet. The company today plans to launch Android and iOS applications within months and currently operates in Delhi/NCR and Bangalore. The platform is mostly for socializing. We started it because we ourselves werent able to find any avenues to meet new people,"" said Somvir Yadav, founder of MyScoot.


A similar platform called Lemonade Social began with the aim of helping creative professionals connect with an audience, and in the process help people meet each other. Artists dont want to play at bars and restaurants anymore because people go there to eat and drink. And you have a bunch of community-driven platforms that come out and say the same things that bars saythat they will keep the money but give you an audience.

"The demand by the parties comes days before the 2nd phase of the ongoing Lok Sabha elections on April 18, when the a total of 97 constituencies across 13 states go to polls. The first of the seven-phase polls was held on April 11.


The Supreme Court had on Monday asked the Election Commission to increase the random matching of VVPAT slips with votes cast through EVMs at five polling booths per assembly segment, from one at present, in the Lok Sabha polls. It had given the direction saying the measure would provide greater satisfaction not just to political parties but the entire electorate. The opposition parties, including the Congress, have been demanding that at least 50% of all votes polled through EVMs be verified against the paper slips of the the voters' verifiable paper audit trail (VVPATs) machines.


A VVPAT is an auxiliary, independent device linked to an electronic voting machine to allow voters to see if the votes cast by them have gone to the right candidate. The VVPATs are also meant to help detect any possible ""election fraud"" or malfunction of EVMs.


The Election Commission of India has decided to use VVAPTs with all the EVMs in the ongoing elections to impart greater transparency and credibility to the country's poll process.

"In an age where cameras are coming up everywhere, making sense of all the hours of stored footage is where the next big policing breakthrough is likely to come from. (iStock)


A new technology is beginning to alter policing. It may have already helped crack a major case, the murder of journalist Gauri Lankesh


While gait analysis has been used as supportive evidence in the UK, its use for forensic purposes has been limited elsewhere


In September 2018, a special investigation team of the Karnataka police identified Parashuram Waghmare as one of the alleged killers of journalist Gauri Lankesh, who was shot dead in 2017 at her Bengaluru residence. The lead came through the examination of the walking pattern of the killers as captured in the CCTV footage at the time of the murder. The Directorate of Forensic Sciences in Gujarat, which was working with the police on the investigation, used a technique called forensic gait analysis to match the walking pattern of the killers with that of the suspects.


Forensic gait analysis is based on the premise that every individuals walking pattern is unique. It comes in handy to identify a person in cases where the CCTV camera has captured the act of the crime but couldnt capture the face of the perpetrator due to poor lighting, the position of the camera, or because the face was covered with a mask or cloth. The technique was first admitted as evidence by a London court in a murder case in 2000. The perpetrator caught on CCTV footage had a bow-legged gait matching one of the suspects, which according to the gait expert who offered testimony during the trial was found in only 5% of the countrys population.


During gait analysis, the walking style of the perpetrator from the CCTV footage is examined to generate a pattern called gait signature. It is then compared with the gait signature generated from a second footage of suspects, which can be from a CCTV footage captured before or after the crime or a re-enactment of it by law enforcement agencies during the investigation as was done in Gauri Lankesh murder investigation. Gait signature is drawn from combination elements such as the posture of the body while walking; hand swing; the position of head, neck and shoulder; knee-flexion during stance; distance between the steps; angle of feet; pelvic rotation and weight distribution.


If done right, forensic gait analysis could possibly revolutionize policing in ways similar to the impact that fingerprint analysis had on the field in the early 20th century. Crime solving is all about matching the remnants of a scene to the person who might have been there. While a fingerprint or hair or blood are clear markers of identity, the way someone walks could be as unique and integral to identity. And in an age where cameras are coming up everywhere, making sense of all the hours of stored footage is where the next big policing breakthrough is likely to come from.


Gait analysis can be done manually by carefully examining every frame of the footage and then drawing a conclusion based entirely on observations. The other and considerably more reliable approach is the computer vision approach, which uses specially designed algorithms to determine a persons gait from a video footage and then compares the gait pattern of the perpetrator with that of the suspect. This approach uses software tools to measure lengths or angles of the limbs during movements across each frame.",age camera coming everywhere making sense hour stored footage next big policing breakthrough likely come istock new technology beginning alter policing may already helped crack major case murder journalist gauri lankesh gait analysis used supportive evidence uk use forensic purpose limited elsewhere september 2018 special investigation team karnataka police identified parashuram waghmare one alleged killer journalist gauri lankesh shot dead 2017 bengaluru residence lead came examination walking pattern killer captured cctv footage time murder directorate forensic science gujarat working police investigation used technique called forensic gait analysis match walking pattern killer suspect forensic gait analysis based premise every individuals walking pattern unique come handy identify person case cctv camera captured act crime couldnt capture face perpetrator due poor lighting position camera face covered mask cloth technique first admitted evidence london court murder case 2000 perpetrator caught cctv footage bowlegged gait matching one suspect according gait expert offered testimony trial found 5 countrys population gait analysis walking style perpetrator cctv footage examined generate pattern called gait signature compared gait signature generated second footage suspect cctv footage captured crime reenactment law enforcement agency investigation done gauri lankesh murder investigation gait signature drawn combination element posture body walking hand swing position head neck shoulder kneeflexion stance distance step angle foot pelvic rotation weight distribution done right forensic gait analysis could possibly revolutionize policing way similar impact fingerprint analysis field early 20th century crime solving matching remnant scene person might fingerprint hair blood clear marker identity way someone walk could unique integral identity age camera coming everywhere making sense hour stored footage next big policing breakthrough likely come gait analysis done manually carefully examining every frame footage drawing conclusion based entirely observation considerably reliable approach computer vision approach us specially designed algorithm determine persons gait video footage compare gait pattern perpetrator suspect approach us software tool measure length angle limb movement across frame,1
"Jet Airways has already lost considerable market share. Returning to normalcy can be an uphill task. (Naveen Kumar Saini/Mint)

"We were seeking implementation of the Agenda of Alliance while trying to evolve some mechanism to engage the youth,"" PDPs youth leader Waheed ur Rehman Parra said. In Kashmir, the people who dominate the streets are below 18. Even militancy recruitment stops at 25. But we had nothing to engage with them. Regardless of the withdrawal of cases against first-time offenders, thousands of the youth started facing law and thanna became their only centre of adverse engagement. This led to the crisis.""


Mark my words,"" Omar Abdullah said days after Burhans killing. Burhans ability to recruit into militancy from the grave will far outstrip anything he could have done on social media."" His grave actually became the new recruiting shrine for militancy. In 2018, Kashmir witnessed 99 anti-militancy operations and 57 of them took place in south Kashmir. As many as 85 civilians were killed in the region in 2018.


Today, south Kashmir has more homegrown militants than foreigners. Every death required a funeral and every funeral was a huge gathering. The politics took a different route for engagement,"" Parra said. These funerals were a rejection of the idea of democracy; these were celebrations of death as BJP ensured PDP fails to deliver.""


These young, well educated, homegrown rebels are a breed apart. While I was desperately looking for my brother and cousin so that I could convince them to renounce militancy, I visited 112 families of militants; almost 90 of them told me the security grid interventions forced them to join militancy,"" Syed Tajamul Imran, a management graduate said. He has already buried his militant brother but his cousin, a police deserter, is still at large.


In Kareemabad, the PDP got 1,400 votes in 2014. Now we have seven graves there. How will we go to seek a vote and how will they actually oblige us?"" Parra asked. In the first term, PDP gave Awantipore the Islamic University and in the second term an AIIMS. In the aftermath of Pulwama suicide attack, a school teacher was brutally killed. This devoured the development narrative from us. We have not even visited the area.""


This situation created indifference towards democracy well before the Lok Sabha elections were announced. In the 2018 fall, when Kashmir governor Satya Pal Malik decided to hold urban local body elections against the advice of the PDP and NC, south Kashmir responded interestingly. There was very low participation130 of the 263 municipal wards remain vacant.


Right now, talking publicly about PDP in most of the region is a sin. But its loss is unlikely to be an NC gain because the PDP continues to be the major political force in the region. That is where the fault line lies.

"The Samsung Galaxy S10 launch event at San Francisco saw the launch of nine devices, including a foldable smartphone and wireless ear buds


The Samsung Galaxy S10 starts at $899 (about ?64,000), while the top-of-the-line S10 Plus goes all the way up to $1,600 (about 1.13 lakh) for the 12GB/1TB variant


Samsung launched nine devices, including Galaxy Fold, S10, S10 Plus and S10e at its Unpacked event held in San Francisco on Wednesday. Although headlined by the aforementioned devices, the event also saw the launch of the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active, Galaxy Fit and Galaxy Buds.


The Galaxy S10 family comes with a completely refreshed designa near bezel-less Infinity-O display at the front with a laser cut hole to accommodate the front-facing camera(s) and horizontally placed rear camera system.


The changes obviously aren't just cosmeticthe innards have received an upgrade as well. Samsung's Exynos 9820 or Qualcomm's Snapdragon 855 SoC is standard on all devices. Memory and storage options range from 6GB RAM and 128GB internal storage on the base Galaxy S10e all the way up to a whopping 12GB of RAM and a terabyte of internal storage on the Galaxy S10 Plus. All Galaxy S10 variants run Samsung's new One UI based on Android Pie 9.


Other specifications like front and rear cameras, fingerprint sensors and battery capacities differ from model to model. Here's how they look:


Undoubtedly the most anticipated device of the lot, the Galaxy S10 boasts a 6.1-inch Dynamic AMOLED display with QHD+ resolution.

"Both phones are capable of gaming, but dont expect top-end, mind-blowing stuffthe highest default graphics setting available on PUBG is medium.


The most utilitarian phone of the lot, the Zenfone Max Pro M1 is easy to be overlooked. But once you get past the glamour of other phones, you see the genius of this one. It comes with up to 64GB of internal storage, 6GB of RAM, Snapdragon 636 processor and a humongous 5,000mAh battery. While the camera performance can be named as run-of-the-mill, this is the perfect smartphone for those who are always on the go and dont have the time to charge up their phones. The UI is one of the more bearable ones and has some really useful features as well.


The Motorola One Power is very similar to the Zenfone Max Pro M1, except that it has a better 6.2-inch display with a pixel density of 402ppi which is more spread out to the edges. It has the same 5,000mAh battery which has fancier charging options like Turbo Charging with a USB Type-C port.


Motorola also has promised a Pie upgrade for this phone, so it is definitely a must buy for those with a peeve to be updated with the latest Android versions.


The Note 6 Pro is a marginal upgrade over the already awesome Note 5 Pro, except that it could have waited a bit longer. It gets an upgrade in its battery capacity, which has been upped to 4,000mAh and an additional camera at the front. The rear camera is great, just like its predecessor, and can give the best camera phones mentioned above a run for their money. The display is also spread out further to the bezels. The rest of the phone, from the processor to the overall design, remains the same. It is still a very good buy at ? 15,999.

"It also exposes non-Apple hardware users to the companys products, potentially pushing them to Apple devices when it is time to upgrade.


The move will give Apple another revenue source for people who purchase movies and TV shows through iTunes, and signals another potential slot for the company to place its long in the works original video content service, which is plans to introduce as early as this year.


In order to compete with Netflix and Amazon Primes original content offerings, which have been around for a number of years, Apple will need as much reach as possible. Samsung TVs held 33% of the smart TV market last year, beating out Vivo, LG, and Sony, according to Statista.


According to Munster, the deal also signals that Apple has no imminent plans to enter the physical TV space. Opening up iTunes to Samsung TVs means that Samsung television users no longer need to purchase an Apple TV set-top-box in order to access Apple content.

This, despite the high order books and revenue growth in the nine months of FY19.

"In the Kaspersky case, the company sold software to the US government until 2017, when American officials expressed concern the products could be used by Moscow to spy on federal information systems. The Department of Homeland Security directed federal agencies to remove its products from government systems and Congress then codified the ban against the Russian company under the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, which President Donald Trump eventually signed.


Kaspersky filed two lawsuits: One sought a declaration that DHS harmed the companys reputation and sales without due process; The second claimed the NDAA violated the Constitutions Bill of Attainder Clause,' which forbids Congress from enacting laws that inflict punishment on individuals and corporations without a trial.


A federal judge in Washington dismissed the suits saying the bans were within the scope of government authority. A federal appeals court agreed, concluding Congress had the right to block purchase of a specific vendors software if it has legitimate security concerns, saying the ban was a prophylactic, not punitive"" measure.


Given the not insignificant probability that Kasperskys products could have compromised federal systems and the magnitude of the harm such an intrusion could have wrought, Congresss decision to remove Kaspersky from federal networks represents a reasonable and balanced response,"" the appeals court said.

"Consumers take it for granted that gadgets will keep getting slimmer, more powerful and cheaper, but the chip companies are running out of ways to etch ever smaller circuit patterns onto silicon. (AFP)


After two decades in development, chipmakers are making a costly bet on a technology that will cram even more transistors onto silicon


After two decades in development, chipmakers are making a costly bet on a technology that will cram even more transistors onto silicon. Their success may hinge on a little-known company in the suburbs of Tokyo.


Lasertec Corp. is the worlds sole maker of equipment that tests glass squares slightly bigger than a CD case that act as a stencil for chip designs. By shining light through the squares, circuits smaller than the width of a few strands of DNA are imprinted onto silicon wafers in a process called lithography.

"However, many of the participants feared that the photos of children could lead to cyberbullying, stalking and kidnapping. Identity theft is no joke. Photos can reveal a lot about your lifestyle, your habits, and they can unintentionally give away your data,"" cautions Toni Birdsong, family safety evangelist for McAfee, who authored the survey.


A few years ago, Google was accosted by a Canadian woman whose photo in a compromising position was captured by a Google Street View vehicle while she was relaxing on the steps of her home. The photo ended up in the Street View platform.


Though Google had blurred the face of the woman, they did not blur the number plate of her car which made her identifiable. In 2014, an iCloud flaw led to a major privacy breach involving hundreds of private photos of celebrity users. In another more recent case from March 2019, a mobile tracker app, MobiiSpy used by parents to monitor their children, was accused by security experts for leaving 95,000 images of users unprotected on servers that were accessible to anyone.


Clearly, these incidents pose a serious question on how many of platforms are handling users photos and whether they are taking the requisite steps to protect them from cybercriminals.",however many participant feared photo child could lead cyberbullying stalking kidnapping identity theft joke photo reveal lot lifestyle habit unintentionally give away data caution toni birdsong family safety evangelist mcafee authored survey year ago google accosted canadian woman whose photo compromising position captured google street view vehicle relaxing step home photo ended street view platform though google blurred face woman blur number plate car made identifiable 2014 icloud flaw led major privacy breach involving hundred private photo celebrity user another recent case march 2019 mobile tracker app mobiispy used parent monitor child accused security expert leaving 95000 image user unprotected server accessible anyone clearly incident pose serious question many platform handling users photo whether taking requisite step protect cybercriminals,1

"In 2014, the UPA, Manmohan Singh and Congress were sliding. Now, we have Modi sarkar, and the BJP is quite resourceful. They have not achieved what they promised in 2014, but the BJP campaign in Odisha is very new. BJP is very aggressive in the state. They say we are a defunct (electric) transformer, our reply is: We are no more dependent on transformers, as we have set up electric grids. Organizationally, BJP is not strong, but they occupy public space via the audio-visual media which propagate their view. The election resources with them are a huge challenge (for us). Was it necessary to have a four-phase election in Odisha? You have one-day elections in Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, but four-phases in Odisha. Once you lengthen the election process, it targets the regional party to a great extent.

Reservation of 33% seats for women has gone down well. We are highlighting how both the BJP and the Congress have betrayed the interests of Odisha in the last 10 years.

"Dhinakaran gave anxious moments when he defeated the official AIADMK candidate in the R.K. Nagar assembly constituency that fell vacant after Jayalalithaas death. Thanks to the BJPs support, it has been a steady ride downhill for Dhinakaranhis houses and property were raided; he was himself jailed on charges of bribing an election commission official in his bid to win the official electoral symbol of the AIADMK. Despite this, the beaming smile on his cherubic face gives the AIADMK leadership the jitters. Most political pundits agree that, even if his party, the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK), cannot win a single seat, he can seriously dent the AIADMKs victory chances.


Despite providing opportunistic and self-serving support, the BJP has kept the AIADMK on tenterhooks. The present Tamil Nadu government has had the houses of both its chief secretary and the director general of police raided by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Raids on a couple of ministers houses add to this dubious distinction. Not too long ago, BJP president Amit Shah dubbed the AIADMK as the most corrupt government in India and heralded a kazhagangal illa Tamilagam (a Tamil Nadu without the Kazhagams)"", analogical to a Congress-mukt (free) Bharat.


Why then the decision to ally with the AIADMK? Put simply, the BJP has nothing to lose. Since 2004, neither the AIADMK nor the DMK has allied with the BJP. What the BJP can bring to the alliance table is exponentially less than the damage it can do to its ally. In other words, aligning with the BJP amounts to the proverbial Dhritarashtra Aalinganam (embrace)in idiomatic English, the kiss of death.


In 2004, the BJP contested six seats in alliance with the AIADMK. Fifteen years later, after completing a full term as the first majority government in a quarter of a century under a charismatic leader as prime minister and a shrewd strategist as party president, the BJP will, in fact, contest one seat less! Surgical strikes, across the border bombing of terrorist camps, etc., seem to have had little bearing on seat sharing. How does one explain this curiosity?


Perhaps no other sitting prime minister has scored so low on the popularity charts in Tamil Nadu. H.D. Deve Gowda and I.K. Gujral were obscure, but not unpopular. The euphoria evoked by Narendra Modi in many sections of the Indian populace and regions has singularly been absent in the state. Anti-Modi slogans are deeply popular. #gobackmodi is a trending hashtag whenever he deigns to visit the state. Inexplicably, everything that goes wrong in Tamil Nadu is attributed to him.


In the hugely popular pro-Jallikattu protests in January 2017, anti-Modi slogans were legion though he had little if anything to do with bullfighting. It was a repeat during the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET) controversy (the national common medical exam was seen as Delhis imposition against the wishes of Tamils). Every slight to Tamil pride, every perceived threat to Tamil identity gets associated with Modi.


Last year, on a visit to Chennai, he barely stepped on Tamil soil. Unfortunately, it is hard not to think that the prime minister has taken this personally. By refusing to meet distressed farmers from the Kaveri delta, by making only a token appearance when the Ockhi storm hit, of all places the only constituency had BJP won; and not visiting the state at all after Cyclone Gaja struck, the prime minister has tended to alienate himself from the Tamil electorate.


The feuding party leaders of the BJPs Tamil Nadu wing have not helped in mitigating this unpopularity. Tamilisai Soundararajan, the partys state unit president, has made it a regular habit of putting her feet in the mouth. H. Rajas intemperate remarks have caused much revulsion. As a shrewd commentator remarked, as long as the BJP relied on the likes of Tamilisai and Raja, Tamil Nadu was safe from Hindutva.",dhinakaran gave anxious moment defeated official aiadmk candidate rk nagar assembly constituency fell vacant jayalalithaas death thanks bjps support steady ride downhill dhinakaranhis house property raided jailed charge bribing election commission official bid win official electoral symbol aiadmk despite beaming smile cherubic face give aiadmk leadership jitter political pundit agree even party amma makkal munnetra kazhagam ammk win single seat seriously dent aiadmks victory chance despite providing opportunistic selfserving support bjp kept aiadmk tenterhook present tamil nadu government house chief secretary director general police raided central bureau investigation cbi raid couple ministers house add dubious distinction long ago bjp president amit shah dubbed aiadmk corrupt government india heralded kazhagangal illa tamilagam tamil nadu without kazhagams analogical congressmukt free bharat decision ally aiadmk put simply bjp nothing lose since 2004 neither aiadmk dmk allied bjp bjp bring alliance table exponentially less damage ally word aligning bjp amount proverbial dhritarashtra aalinganam embracein idiomatic english kiss death 2004 bjp contested six seat alliance aiadmk fifteen year later completing full term first majority government quarter century charismatic leader prime minister shrewd strategist party president bjp fact contest one seat less surgical strike across border bombing terrorist camp etc seem little bearing seat sharing one explain curiosity perhaps sitting prime minister scored low popularity chart tamil nadu hd deve gowda ik gujral obscure unpopular euphoria evoked narendra modi many section indian populace region singularly absent state antimodi slogan deeply popular gobackmodi trending hashtag whenever deigns visit state inexplicably everything go wrong tamil nadu attributed hugely popular projallikattu protest january 2017 antimodi slogan legion though little anything bullfighting repeat national eligibility cum entrance test neet controversy national common medical exam seen delhis imposition wish tamil every slight tamil pride every perceived threat tamil identity get associated modi last year visit chennai barely stepped tamil soil unfortunately hard think prime minister taken personally refusing meet distressed farmer kaveri delta making token appearance ockhi storm hit place constituency bjp visiting state cyclone gaja struck prime minister tended alienate tamil electorate feuding party leader bjps tamil nadu wing helped mitigating unpopularity tamilisai soundararajan partys state unit president made regular habit putting foot mouth h rajas intemperate remark caused much revulsion shrewd commentator remarked long bjp relied like tamilisai raja tamil nadu safe hindutva,0

"The childhood hometown of Mahatma Gandhi, who was always rather sceptical of rapid industrialization, is home to more than 500 small and medium manufacturing units. Maruti Suzuki, the countrys largest carmaker, sources about 90% of its supplies from foundries or small factories in and around Rajkot.


Western Gujarats fourth-largest city, Rajkot is the seventh fastest-growing city in the world, according to a report published last year by UK-based forecasting and quantitative analysts Oxford Economics. Ramesh Monani, a retired banker and resident of the city, credits much of the growth of Rajkot to the industrious nature of the Patel community, which accounts for 13% of the states population.


The rapid industrialization is putting to the test the resolve of civic authorities and elected representatives as residents flag many infrastructure problems that come with a fast-growing city. Rajkot does not have a Metro, which means that most workers dont have access to cheap, reliable and fast public transport. The migration of hundreds of workers from the Saurashtra peninsula of the state puts Rajkot under pressure to provide shelter, clean water, healthcare facilities and education.


As the citys more than 1.88 million voters prepare to cast their ballots on Tuesday, these are among the issues on their minds.

"In typical Oppo fashion, the camera wants you beautify you. Realme says it factors in the aesthetic views of local youths in tuning cameras and optimizes selfie beauty features accordingly"".


It essentially makes your skin appear without blemishes and smoothens everything out, makes your eyes bigger, jaw slimmer and cheeks more protrudingdepending on your settings. You can also put everything on the AI to make you look pretty.


Selfies without the AI selfie mode also look good, and I personally prefer myself with my small eyes. They are well lit and thanks to the wide aperture and pixel size, you consistently get well-lit images. I wish this was the camera at the rear of the phone.


The rear camera comprises a 13MP+2MP module, which is also powered with AI. Camera modes include AI scene recognition, multi-frame noise reduction, portrait lighting, pro mode and slo-mo. While the AI-scene recognition works well in well lit and semi-well lit scenarios, its a little difficult to use at night. Everything appears a bit too smooth, since high ISO and noise reduction are working hand in hand.


The pro-mode has one of the best implementations in any camera app period. Its extremely intuitive and easy to use. No circular dials, no mumbo-jumbo, it is spot on.


Realme U1 ticks nearly all the boxes required to be a good sub-Rs 15,000 smartphone. A phone with the top MediaTek processor is a good addition to the Realme line-up and so is that selfie camera. The resemblance with the Realme 2 Pro is uncanny, but once youre past that its a good phone very worthy of its price tag.

Realme has had a phenomenal run right after its launch in India. A counterpoint report said that the Oppo spinoff had become the third largest smartphone brand in India in six months. It also recently gave itself a new identity altogether, with a new logo and typeface, focusing on the youth.


One thing becomes clear after observing their new campaignthe company pictures the youth as a selfie and gaming obsessed crowd. A month ago, they launched the Realme 2 and Real 2 Pro, right after launching a video online which goes by the name Proud to be Young"". While the Realme 2 was marred with a lacklustre processor and low-res display, the Realme 2 Pro was more of a complete package.


Then on Wednesday, the company launched the Realme U1, a phone they call the Selfie Pro"". Boasting the newest (and the best) chipset from MediaTek, the phone is expected to add more variety in the sub-Rs 15,000 market. But does it really make sense for Realme to put out two very similar smartphones in quick succession? Lets find out.


An untrained eye will fail to distinguish the Realme 2 Pro and Realme U1 from the outside. Both have exactly the same design, display, physical dimensions, weight and even the camera and loudspeaker grille placement. The only way to distinguish the two phones would be by their colour schemes.


The Realme U1 comes in three colour variantsAmbitious Black, Brave Blue and Fiery Gold. While Ambitious Black and Brave Blue are extremely similar to Blue Ocean and Black Sea variants of the Realme 2 Pro, the Fiery Gold is a new colour and that is the only way you can distinguish the two phones physically.

"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks during the F8 Facebook Developers conference on April 30, 2019 in San Jose, California. (AFP)


Zuckerberg identified private messaging, ephemeral stories and small groups as the fastest-growing areas of online communication


Facebook Inc debuted an overhaul of its core social network on Tuesday, taking its first concrete steps to refashion itself into a private messaging and e-commerce company as it tries to move past scandals while tapping new revenue sources.


Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg unveiled a fresh design for the world's biggest social network that de-emphasized its News Feed. It also ditched the signature blue banner that has been on the app since its launch.


The new design showcases Facebook's messaging app, online marketplace and video-on-demand site, while giving greater prominence to the popular photo-driven Stories feature.


The company also rolled out features aimed at encouraging users to interact with their close social circle as well as with businesses, such as a ""Secret Crush"" option for Facebook Dating and a tool for appointment booking.


""As the world gets bigger and more connected, we need that sense of intimacy more than ever. That's why I believe that the future is private.

"By the third quarter of 2018, the market was flooded with smartphones that sported a notch cut-out, with varying shapes and sizes. In August, Oppo announced the F9 Pro, with a dew drop/tear drop/water drop notch. This quickly caught on with its sister brands, including OnePlus, and we saw devices like the OnePlus 6T, Realme 2 Pro and Vivo V11 Pro.


But Samsung refrained from using any notches on its smartphones and instead focused on bringing its Infinity Display"" to its affordable handsets.


While Vivo Nex is widely regarded as that smartphone with a pop-up camera"", it was also one of the first to sport an in-display fingerprint scanner, a technology that several other smartphone makers started to seek. The technology relies on an optical fingerprint sensor, which uses a light source to capture a high-resolution photograph of your fingerprints and uses algorithms to identify unique patterns. To capture a high-resolution image, it requires a light source, which has to be strong enough to illuminate your fingerprint. The problem arises when the light has to hit the sensor after bouncing back from your finger. As a result, this tech can work only with OLED displays, since an LCDs backlight can get in the way.


The rudimentary renditions of this tech were quite cumbersome, especially in my experience. The speed is already slow to begin with (it takes anywhere between half a second to two seconds), and any type of interferencebe it tempered glass or scratches on the display leads inaccurate fingerprint capture. If youre a person prone to dropping your phone, this tech isnt for you.


The first quarter of the year also saw facial unlocking become more accessible to people. While it is a little less secure than a physical fingerprint scanner, its more convenient.


But its unfair to assume that most smartphone tech surrounded around the display. Flip a 2018 smartphone and youll see a drastic difference from a smartphone of any era. You have glass backs, number of cameras ranging between one and four and striking colour gradientsit has become crazy out here.


While glass backs add an element of luxury, they also make smartphones extremely fragile. To fix this, some smartphones have started adding polycarbonate resin (a fancy name for faux glass plastic), which is shatter resistant and is more durable. It is also heat resistant, so during winters, these smartphones dont get uncomfortably cold to touch.",third quarter 2018 market flooded smartphones sported notch cutout varying shape size august oppo announced f9 pro dew droptear dropwater drop notch quickly caught sister brand including oneplus saw device like oneplus 6t realme 2 pro vivo v11 pro samsung refrained using notch smartphones instead focused bringing infinity display affordable handset vivo nex widely regarded that smartphone popup camera also one first sport indisplay fingerprint scanner technology several smartphone maker started seek technology relies optical fingerprint sensor us light source capture highresolution photograph fingerprint us algorithm identify unique pattern capture highresolution image requires light source strong enough illuminate fingerprint problem arises light hit sensor bouncing back finger result tech work oled display since lcds backlight get way rudimentary rendition tech quite cumbersome especially experience speed already slow begin take anywhere half second two second type interferencebe tempered glass scratch display lead inaccurate fingerprint capture youre person prone dropping phone tech isnt first quarter year also saw facial unlocking become accessible people little less secure physical fingerprint scanner its convenient its unfair assume smartphone tech surrounded around display flip 2018 smartphone youll see drastic difference smartphone era glass back number camera ranging one four striking colour gradientsit become crazy glass back add element luxury also make smartphones extremely fragile fix smartphones started adding polycarbonate resin fancy name faux glass plastic shatter resistant durable also heat resistant winter smartphones dont get uncomfortably cold touch,1

"Loon joins a long line of ambitious projects aimed at helping underserved Africans. Facebook Inc. in June ditched a program to build passenger jet-sized drones to deliver Internet because global aviation and spectrum regulations dont support the system. Instead, Facebook has said it will work with partners like Airbus SE on high-altitude connectivity.


Facebook in 2016 had to abandon an effort to provide internet via satellites when a SpaceX rocket carrying the rig exploded on the launchpad, but the company is working on another satellite program. And SpaceX itself plans to launch more than 4,000 low-orbit satellites to build a global broadband networkan initiative that will cost billions. The continent is waiting for the promise of low-earth-orbit satellites to materialize,"" says Joao Sousa, a partner at tech consultancy Delta Partners. If balloons beat the odds and succeed, it would be a game changer.""

Bringing fast, widespread internet to rural Africa has proven vexing for companies that have triedand largely failedwith strategies ranging from drones to satellites. Now, a sister company of Google says it has the answer: balloons.


Loon, spun out of the search giants X innovation lab in July, is teaming up with Telkom Kenya Ltd. to build a network of high-flying balloons to connect people in the east African country starting next year. The prize for Alphabet Inc., the parent of Google, is the opportunity to profit from advertising and other businesses tied to bringing the web to more of sub-Saharan Africa, where hundreds of millions of people lack net access.


Loons Kenyan project is modelled on technology used to temporarily connect people in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria last year knocked out power supplies and phone service. In Kenya, Loon says it will start with about a dozen balloonsenough to cover roughly 10 percent of the countryand gauge how many more are needed. Loon has begun work with the operator to install ground stations in Nairobi and the city of Nakuru in the western highlands that will beam signals to the balloons.",balloon solar panel recharge battery stay aloft several month must brought servicing photo loon loon spun search giant x innovation lab july teaming telkom kenya ltd build network highflying balloon connect people east african country starting next year bringing fast widespread internet rural africa proven vexing company triedand largely failedwith strategy ranging drone satellite sister company google say answer balloon loon spun search giants x innovation lab july teaming telkom kenya ltd build network highflying balloon connect people east african country starting next year prize alphabet inc parent google opportunity profit advertising business tied bringing web subsaharan africa hundred million people lack net access loons kenyan project modelled technology used temporarily connect people puerto rico hurricane maria last year knocked power supply phone service kenya loon say start dozen balloonsenough cover roughly 10 percent countryand gauge many needed loon begun work operator install ground station nairobi city nakuru western highland beam signal balloon,1

Even the 1,400x900 LED-backlit display has started to look outdated, along with its massive bezels.

London: Apple Inc. introduced the world to its largest-ever smartphone on Wednesday, the iPhone Xs Max. With a 6.5-inch screen, it dwarfs the 3.5-inch display on the original iPhone that Steve Jobs unveiled to the world in 2007. Its also one of the biggest and most costly phones to hit the market, with prices starting at $1,099. Onlookers will be forgiven for seeing the Max as a response to the popular Galaxy Note series made by Samsung Electronics Co. The latest in that line, the Galaxy Note 9, was released in August and has a 6.4-inch screen.


Samsungs Note 9 is the lighter of the two phones, weighing 201 grams compared to Apples 208 grams. But the iPhone is about 13 percent thinner.

"While the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) has given more tickets to upper castes as well as other and extremely backward classes, the opposition is attempting a balancing act with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) fielding more Yadav candidates, and the Congress focusing on upper castes. The opposition mahagatbandhan is also appealing to smaller groups through caste leaders like Upendra Kushwaha, Jitan Ram Manjhi and Mukesh Sahani.


This time, the mahagatbandhans caste arithmetic looks strong on paper with the RJD confident of drawing support from Yadavs (14%), Manjhi from Musahars (3%), Upendra Kushwaha from Kushwahas (6%), Sahani from Nishads (6%) and Congress from a section of upper caste voters (17%), going by estimates. The NDA draws its support from the BJPs chunk of upper caste (17%) and non-Yadav OBC voters, JD(U)s Kurmi (4%) and EBC support and Lok Jan Shakti Partys Paswan base (5%), which are also estimates.


As elections become more closely fought contests, caste consolidation will have to go beyond vote shares and convert into seats to yield electoral success. For instance, in the 2014 general election, the BJP had less than one third of the vote share (29.86%) but won more than two-thirds of the seats it contested (22 out of 30). On the other hand, the RJD won just four seats with a 20.46% vote share and the JD(U) just two seats with a 16.04% share. With such a keen focus on caste, voters feel the outcome of the general election will depend on which alliance is able to consolidate more on a seat-to-seat basis.


It is rare to find leaders who work for everyone. If we vote in someone not of our caste, they will not work for us. We vote for our caste because we have to choose from what political parties offer. Frankly, there is very little to choose from because parties decide candidates on the basis of caste,"" said Prem Kumar Rai, a farmer from Gopalganj who also runs a general store.",bharatiya janata party bjpled national democratic alliance nda given ticket upper caste well extremely backward class opposition attempting balancing act rashtriya janata dal rjd fielding yadav candidate congress focusing upper caste opposition mahagatbandhan also appealing smaller group caste leader like upendra kushwaha jitan ram manjhi mukesh sahani time mahagatbandhans caste arithmetic look strong paper rjd confident drawing support yadavs 14 manjhi musahars 3 upendra kushwaha kushwahas 6 sahani nishads 6 congress section upper caste voter 17 going estimate nda draw support bjps chunk upper caste 17 nonyadav obc voter jdus kurmi 4 ebc support lok jan shakti partys paswan base 5 also estimate election become closely fought contest caste consolidation go beyond vote share convert seat yield electoral success instance 2014 general election bjp less one third vote share 2986 twothirds seat contested 22 30 hand rjd four seat 2046 vote share jdu two seat 1604 share keen focus caste voter feel outcome general election depend alliance able consolidate seattoseat basis it rare find leader work everyone vote someone caste work u vote caste choose political party offer frankly little choose party decide candidate basis caste said prem kumar rai farmer gopalganj also run general store,0

"Rapid advancements in AI and machine learning, supported by increased computing power, have enhanced the sophistication of robots, which continue to replace redundant and hazardous work activities once performed by humans. We see industrial robots playing a pivotal role in the rise of Industry 4.0 and countries with declining or ageing population, such as Korea, Singapore, Japan, Sweden, and Germany will be the front-runners in industrial robots adoption. Industrial robot sales in India also has rocketed and is expected to continue its momentum, driven by use cases across logistics, agriculture and manufacturing.


Blockchain is seeing significant investment across a range of industries. We see successful use cases where the trust paradigm needs to be decentralized (via the elimination of a central counterparty), large ecosystems need to be integrated and automation is critical. Governments across the world are leading the way and in some cases are mandating the use of this technology as they build next-generation citizen services and infrastructure platforms. However, on-boarding all players in an ecosystem is not easy and several critical technical issues including scalability will need to be addressed for this technology to achieve mainstream adoption.


VR (immersive computer-generated world) and AR (overlaying virtual environment onto the real-world) have been touted as technologies that will transform how we interact with the world, but their adoption across enterprises has been underwhelming. In the coming years, we expect the adoption of AR-VR in enterprises to grow rapidly, especially across use cases related to advertising, retail, healthcare and education and training.

"The numerous tax incentives are unlikely to have a huge effect on realty firms in the listed universe. Heres why.


The extension of the tax exemption for affordable housing projects by one more year until FY20 may spur more projects in the segment. As it is, between Q2 FY18 and Q2 FY19, about 55% of home sales were from units priced less than ?50 lakh across eight tier I cities in India.


However, higher sales volume would be offset by a fall in the average ticket size of residential units. According to Crisil Research, For ticket size above ?1 crore, the share of units launched between 2017 and 2018 declined to 10-15%, compared with 30-35% before 2017.

"Compounding the issue is an information vacuum. Page Industries did not specify how much of an impact the accounting change had on its revenue. Further, as analysts at ICICI Securities point out, it stopped disclosing segment-wise data, making it difficult to track category-wise product growth.


This is fuelling concerns about growth momentum at its mainstay inner wear business, where companies such as Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail Ltd are making headway.


Of course, the shift to the organized sector on the introduction of GST will create enough elbow room for all market participants.

New Delhi: When you take a look at the smartphones of the past few years, its not difficult to call out which one belonged to which era. Heres a fun thing you can try out: here are six pictures with six smartphones belonging to different manufacturers and different years. Try to guess the year the smartphones were manufactured in:


The first smartphone in the first picture is the Samsung Galaxy S4 launched in 2013, the second is the iPhone 3GS launched in 2009 and then you have the Xiaomi Redmi 3 launched in 2015. In the second picture you have the Samsung Galaxy Note Edge launched in 2014, the Apple iPhone X launched in 2017 and finally the Huawei Mate 20 Pro launched in 2018.


As you can see, there is a gradual shift in design and aesthetics of smartphones, and lately, its been dictated by four aspectsscreen-to-body ratios of the display, the front and rear camera placement, choice of back panel materials and textures, and finally biometric options like a fingerprint scanner.


Many people like to think the race to eliminate display bezels was kickstarted this year by two major playersVivo and Oppotwo brands belonging to the same umbrella company, BBK Electronics. It is no surprise that the two brands share their resources, along with Realme and OnePlus.


Vivo in June announced the Vivo Nexthe worlds first smartphone to feature a motorised front facing camera. Since there was no camera to obstruct the front of the phone, the display could be stretched further to the bezels; in fact, the Nex has a screen-to-body ratio of 86%, the highest at the time of its launch.


As more manufacturers explored possibilities in this area, we received rather interesting devices like the Oppo Find X, the Honor Magic 2 and the Mi Mix 3.


While this was a feature many premium smartphones carried, manufacturers also made the notch ubiquitous in affordable smartphonesa feature that was a symbol of luxury, thanks to Apple iPhone X.",mintindiawire smartphonessmartphones 2018best smartphones 2018iphone xsiphone x maxoneplus 6thuawei mate 20 prosamsung galaxy note 9realme 2 prooppo r17 provivo v11 proin display finger print scannerfacial unlockingandroid pieandroid oreogesture navigation5gfoldable display new delhi take look smartphones past year its difficult call one belonged era heres fun thing try six picture six smartphones belonging different manufacturer different year try guess year smartphones manufactured first smartphone first picture samsung galaxy s4 launched 2013 second iphone 3gs launched 2009 xiaomi redmi 3 launched 2015 second picture samsung galaxy note edge launched 2014 apple iphone x launched 2017 finally huawei mate 20 pro launched 2018 see gradual shift design aesthetic smartphones lately its dictated four aspectsscreentobody ratio display front rear camera placement choice back panel material texture finally biometric option like fingerprint scanner many people like think race eliminate display bezel kickstarted year two major playersvivo oppotwo brand belonging umbrella company bbk electronics surprise two brand share resource along realme oneplus vivo june announced vivo nexthe worlds first smartphone feature motorised front facing camera since camera obstruct front phone display could stretched bezel fact nex screentobody ratio 86 highest time launch manufacturer explored possibility area received rather interesting device like oppo find x honor magic 2 mi mix 3 feature many premium smartphones carried manufacturer also made notch ubiquitous affordable smartphonesa feature symbol luxury thanks apple iphone x,1

"Gold prices on Thursday held near eight-month highs hit in the previous session, as the dollar weakened after the US Federal Reserve paused its monetary tightening cycle, putting bullion on course for its fourth straight monthly gain.


Spot gold was steady at $1,319.72 per ounce by 0308 GMT. Prices rose to their highest since May 11 at $1,323.34 on Wednesday. US gold futures were up 0.6% at $1,317.70 per ounce. Spot gold has risen 2.8% so far this month. The Fed held US interest rates steady on Wednesday but said it would be patient in lifting borrowing costs further this year as it pointed to rising uncertainty about the economic outlook.


""Gold is getting a double whammy from a dovish Fed and US-China trade talks. The US dollar has been sold off across the board, supporting gold,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst, OANDA. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, fell after the Fed's cautious statement. Gold tends to rise on expectations of lower interest rates, which reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.


Meanwhile, attention turned towards the US and China high-level trade talks that began on Wednesday, aimed at digging out from their months-long trade war.",gold price thursday held near eightmonth high hit previous session dollar weakened u federal reserve paused monetary tightening cycle putting bullion course fourth straight monthly gain spot gold steady 131972 per ounce 0308 gmt price rose highest since may 11 132334 wednesday u gold future 06 131770 per ounce spot gold risen 28 far month fed held u interest rate steady wednesday said would patient lifting borrowing cost year pointed rising uncertainty economic outlook gold getting double whammy dovish fed uschina trade talk u dollar sold across board supporting gold said jeffrey halley senior market analyst oanda dollar index measure greenback basket currency fell fed cautious statement gold tends rise expectation lower interest rate reduce opportunity cost holding nonyielding bullion meanwhile attention turned towards u china highlevel trade talk began wednesday aimed digging monthslong trade war,3

"The companys latest laptop is aimed at students from families with income of under ?2 lakh income per annum. RDP worked with a team from IIT Bombay, to make a special version of the Thinbook, meant for college students and bulk orders.


Design: Out of the box, the Thinbook actually impresses in terms of design. While it has a plastic body, the focus here is on keeping things utilitarian, but functional. The laptop weighs just over 1kg, helping keep a students bag light. Its also thin and compact enough, so that it fits in almost any college bag along with books.


Performance: A factor that limits the audience for this laptop, though, is that it runs Debian Linuxan operating system that not many are familiar with. That said, if the primary audience is students who will use this to practise coding and access the internet, this may not be a problem.


One could easily argue that the Thinbook is extremely slow, except that alternatives like those made by better-known brands such as iBall or Micromax arent much faster either.

"However, we noticed a significant frame drop when the laptop was running without the power adapters plugged in. This is because the laptops desktop-grade hardware requires the 330 watt and 180 watt adapters to be plugged in to deliver the best results.

The laptops cooling mechanism works pretty effectively and keeps the chassis cool.

"Ive written about the futility of cash transfers and how they do not help. Both parties are ambivalent on how the expenditure will be funded, or they will continue alongside existing subsidies. Partisan economists on both sides are busy picking holes in the other partys scheme without recognizing the inherent weakness of all cash transfers.


In trying to hard-sell their own versions of the cash transfer schemes, both parties have unwittingly revealed their characteristic frailties. The BJP announced the scheme only for farmers with 2 hectares but has now promised to expand it to all farmers. The fine print in the Congress scheme discloses that actual payouts are likely to be delayed with the means-testing taking some time.


The overall tenor of the BJP manifesto is meant to appeal to the majoritarian, urban middle class with national security concerns, rather than a sluggish economy, occupying headlines. The 2014 manifesto had some pretensions of universality, which ""Sankalp Patra"" dispenses with.


The Congress manifesto, on the other hand, is bound together with a more inclusive and humane thread but is weighed down by one key genetic flaw: a subtle patronizing attitude, which is highlighted when the manifesto talks about enforcing anti-corruption laws without a tinge of irony.",ive written futility cash transfer help party ambivalent expenditure funded continue alongside existing subsidy partisan economist side busy picking hole partys scheme without recognizing inherent weakness cash transfer trying hardsell version cash transfer scheme party unwittingly revealed characteristic frailty bjp announced scheme farmer 2 hectare promised expand farmer fine print congress scheme discloses actual payouts likely delayed meanstesting taking time overall tenor bjp manifesto meant appeal majoritarian urban middle class national security concern rather sluggish economy occupying headline 2014 manifesto pretension universality sankalp patra dispenses congress manifesto hand bound together inclusive humane thread weighed one key genetic flaw subtle patronizing attitude highlighted manifesto talk enforcing anticorruption law without tinge irony,0

The OnePlus 6T will be available exclusively on Amazon starting 1 November and will go on open sale starting 3 November on offline (Reliance Digital) and online channels.


It has been raining smartphones in the premium segment in the last couple of months. After the Apple iPhone XS (review) series and iPhone XR (review), Google Pixel 3 and 3XL (review), and Huaweis Mate 20 Pro, it is time for the OnePlus 6T. As expected, the smartphone will replace the OnePlus 6, which was launched six months ago, as the OnePlus flagship in the market.


While it retains most of the design element of the OnePlus 6, it manages to look new, thanks to the teardrop-shaped notch on the top. It takes a lot less space than the earlier notch. However, not all apps support the teardrop and one can see black bars at the top while using them.

"Among smart beds, Sleep Number 360 is quite popular in the US.

It can also tilt the head side of the bed upwards if it hears"" the user snore and switches on the foot warmer if the users legs are cold. It has built-in sensors called Sleep IQ to monitor the users heart rate, breathing, movement and sleep quality. It is available in the US for $999.


Then there is the Sunrise smart pillow, which is slightly curved in the middle to provide more ergonomic support. The pillow has LED lights built into the sides that gradually brighten to simulate a natural wake-up process. It can also monitor the sleep quality, read out e-books and has a built-in alarm. Then there are anti-snoring pillows, which monitor breathing and gently turn the head to the side if the user starts snoring.


Turning of the head to the side increases the gap between the tongue and throat, which stops the vibration of the soft tissues in the upper airways and reduces the snoring sound as well as allows better breathing,"" said Dr Sandeep Nayar, director and head of Centre for Chest and Respiratory Diseases at BLK Super Speciality Hospital in Delhi.

"Each new app is another revenue opportunity for Apple because it takes a cut of many app-related purchases and subscriptions. The company has positioned its services division as a major growth area. It plans to announce two new services  a premium Apple News subscription offering and an original video content initiative  at the end of March, Bloomberg News reported recently.


Later this year, Apple plans to let developers port their iPad apps to Mac computers via a new software development kit that the company will release as early as June at its annual developer conference. Developers will still need to submit separate versions of the app to Apples iOS and Mac App Stores, but the new kit will mean they dont have to write the underlying software code twice, said the people familiar with the plan.


In 2020, Apple plans to expand the kit so iPhone applications can be converted into Mac apps in the same way. Apple engineers have found this challenging because iPhone screens are so much smaller than Mac computer displays.


By 2021, developers will be able to merge iPhone, iPad, and Mac applications into one app or what is known as a single binary.""

"Trend Micro researchers, too, pointed out last month that IoT has given rise to complex IoT environments (CIE) comprising at least 10 IoT devices that are functionally chained together and integrated into an environment using an IoT automation platform. For instance, a smart home has an internet connection throughout the entire CIE, which requires Ethernet or fiber wiring and modems and Wi-Fi routers.


Devices integrated into the environment can include a gateway, smart bulbs, smart locks, speakers and TVs. The complexity afforded by automation platforms, note Trend Micro researchers, expands the possibilities in smart homes and buildings and other setups in various settings. However, they caution that the increasing complexity with each additional device and automation rule also means an expanding attack surface.


For instance, if smart locks are installed and connected to the CIE, attackers could modify automation rules that would allow them entry into the home and make the sensors either recognize them as one of the homeowners or leave the doors unlocked. Attackers could also analyze and clone the owners voice and play the resulting sound file to bypass any voice recognition checks by connected devices in the CIE.


Homeowners, thus, should check automation rule files and make backups, advise the Trend Micro researchers. They should also enable two-factor authentication where applicable.",trend micro researcher pointed last month iot given rise complex iot environment cie comprising least 10 iot device functionally chained together integrated environment using iot automation platform instance smart home internet connection throughout entire cie requires ethernet fiber wiring modem wifi router device integrated environment include gateway smart bulb smart lock speaker tv complexity afforded automation platform note trend micro researcher expands possibility smart home building setup various setting however caution increasing complexity additional device automation rule also mean expanding attack surface instance smart lock installed connected cie attacker could modify automation rule would allow entry home make sensor either recognize one homeowner leave door unlocked attacker could also analyze clone owners voice play resulting sound file bypass voice recognition check connected device cie homeowner thus check automation rule file make backup advise trend micro researcher also enable twofactor authentication applicable,1
"The consolidation in the sector has hit tenancies and revenues, with companies such as Vodafone Idea Ltd getting rid of duplicate tower infrastructure.

"Google is testing a new feature, Navigation suggestions for lookalike URLs"", that detects lookalike URLs (uniform resource locators) and flags them. It has rolled out Password Checkup, which tells users if their passwords have been compromised. The Chrome team is testing a Never Slow Mode"" that trims resource-intensive web pages by limiting the resources to be allocated to images, style sheet, scripts and fonts. Google is changing the way ad-blocking extensions work by enforcing a new application programming interface (API) for extensions to enhance performance and user privacy.


Registering fake web pages with similar domain names is a common tactic used by hackers to lure users on to malicious web pages. Googles move will help users who do not carefully read the URL names. Similarly, the Password Checkup feature will tell users which passwords are not safe any more, so that they can change or update them.

"On the ground, the core support base of the BJP feels that the combination of Modi and Kumar gives the alliance the edge and the policy schemes of the central government, particularly rural electrification, adds its weight.


Bihar is a contest between two alliances. One alliance has a prime minister and another has too many prime ministerial candidates. For people like us, the choice is clear as Prime Minister Narendra Modi has done good work while the opposition camp is only about a few leaders coming together to defeat Modi,"" said Vijay Kumar, a seed shop owner in Danapur. The lack of a cohesive and larger opposition narrative other than ousting Modi is a factor in Bihar too as in other states.


Kumar could be a decisive factor for the NDAs performance in the polls. While he is a popular chief minister who has returned to power, a section of voters hold it against him that he switched sides to join the NDA in 2015 after ditching the RJD-Congress combine.


In 2014, in the general election, BJP got a lot of traction because the opposition camp was totally fragmented.

"The XR screen also falls short of full high definition, unlike the XS displays, although it can display video at 720p quality. Apple says that with LCD screens, higher resolution drains the battery faster, a trade-off that's minimal with the XS because its screen doesn't need a backlight.


That said, the differences are often hard to spot, even with the phones side by side. Where quality really matters, you'll probably want a bigger screen such as a tablet or a TV anyway.


Although the Max has the largest battery in an iPhone, the XR was typically on par with or exceeded the Max in battery performance when viewing video, especially at lower or medium brightness. In any case, either phone should give you enough battery life for routine use.


Cameras improve with each generation, and the new iPhones are no different. For many shots, the new iPhones blend four exposures rather than two, allowing for better lighting balance and more detail. In some shots taken in suboptimal conditions  against direct sunlight  the XR still showed trees in dimly lit areas, while last year's iPhone X produced pitch back.

"We need 2,000 to 2,500 litres of diesel for a two-week trip. All the costs for a fishing expedition, including food, wages and diesel, add up to ?2 lakh or ?2.25 lakh for a single trip,"" said Satish Patil, a fisherman who owns two boats. Most trips barely cover the costs.""


Machimar or the fishing community accounts for a sixth or 42,000 of the citys 246,119 votes. This seems like a substantial vote bank but for politicians, its not large enough. The city of Porbandar, along with six land-locked municipalities that comprise Porbandar district, has a total of 16.6 million voters. The number of fisherfolk votes in the district total about 65,000. This is one reason why the concerns of fishermen are not on the agenda of either the BJP or Congress as the state prepares to vote on 23 April. How does the fishing community plan to address this issue?


We have many options. One way is to decide as a block that we will not vote. Well see what happens. But this issue needs to be addressed immediately,"" says Modi. A fishermans life, even if you own a boat, is no longer a respectable profession, and for this reason, most members of this community do not want their children to get into fishing. The number of fishermen in the district is increasing but its because of immigrants from neighbouring districts and states rather than the local communities themselves teaching their children the skills and traditional knowledge of the sea .


I have two children. The older one is 17 and the younger one is 11 years old. Both are studying in private schools.

"Others in the village have more pressing arguments. People will vote on the basis of the kind of benefits given,"" said Ravi, who runs the local milk cooperative society. Most political parties have made a lot of pledges, ranging from farm loan waivers to direct cash transfers to minimum income guarantee schemes. However, comparing benefits alone may not work in Karnataka, according to locals.


The Janata Dal (Secular), or JD(S), and Congress swiftly circumvented last years fractured verdict in the assembly elections by adding up numbers, in the process overlooking the rough equation between the traditional rivals, who share a bitter and violent past. Since then, the level of distrust between workers, leaders and top brass of the two parties appears to have plummettedits worse than when they worked as individual parties.


Wherever there is a JD(S) candidate, the Congress vote will split and vice versa. That is likely to benefit the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP),"" says Mahadev Prakash Shivanna, a Bengaluru-based political analyst.


A seat-sharing agreement has deepened the divide, especially in south Karnataka, where workers of the two parties can barely see eye-to-eye. Congress workers are refusing to work for the JD(S) candidate in Mandya, Nikhil Kumaraswamy, the son of H.D. Kumaraswamy, and are instead rallying behind independent Sumalatha Amarnath (Sumalatha Ambareesh), wife of Kannada actor M.H.Amarnath who died in November last year, who has the support of the BJP.

The state has had it rough in the last decade. It lost YSR in 2009 and was bifurcated into Telangana in 2014. There is anger against national parties for dividing the state. Telangana, the newest state, got a large share of resources and the state capital. The parent state was denied a special package by BJP, a key reason for Naidu to walk out of NDA.

"The Sebi order did not go into whether any financial gain was made by the alleged misuse of the NSE data.


Among the multiple angles investigated by the stock market regulator in the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd (NSE) co-location case, one pertains to the alleged misuse of exchange data for commercial gains.

"Pramod Kumar Ram, a senior RJD leader and state secretary from Gopalganj, recalls seeing Prasad for the first time during the Mandal agitation in the early 1990s in Patna. Ram describes how Prasad leapt out of a jeep on the way to Gandhi Maidan and dared security personnel to arrest him. I was drawn by his fearlessness. Whenever he held a public meeting, people would cycle hours from villages to get a glimpse of him. He was chatty, engaging and funny at his meetings. He could remember peoples faces and names, and that really is the greatest quality of a leader,"" Ram said.


For two decades, RJD and its election symbol, the lantern, have been synonymous with Prasad. At rallies, his photographs form the backdrop and publicity material is replete with his words and pictures though he is not on the trail.


Naturally, our party and its campaign would have been stronger (with his presence). Our opponents would have been weaker. He is a mass leader and his presence makes a difference. But still, if one goes out with the flag of Lalujis party, people like you, and they stand up for you,"" Tejashwi Yadav, Prasads younger son, told Mint.


In an earlier interview, Tejashwi said, Last time we met, seat-sharing talks were on. When we meet him in Ranchi, we talk about everything. We talk about home, we talk about politics. He gives advice.""


Early in April, Prasad wrote an open letter to his voters, which was released on his Twitter handle, from the hospital ward in Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) in Ranchi, where he has served eight months of his prison term. Everything is at stake in this election - country, society, Lalu, who in other words gave you the aspiration to move about as equals with your heads held high and your rights, self-respect and dignity,"" he wrote.


The family is in touch with him regularly. Every key decisionseat-sharing, choice of candidates, the partys focus on reservationis vetted by him,"" said a senior party member, requesting anonymity.


But giving advice from far cannot substitute being on the ground. The organizing capacity that Lalu brought to the table is no longer there.

"Based on Mondays share price, Jet Airways enterprise value (EV) works out to ?31,800 crore. This includes the present value of future rentals, using a rough capitalization factor of seven times rentals, and calculates market capitalization using an expanded equity base. This would mean an EV-Ebitdar ratio of 12.5 times using FY18 earnings, a relatively stable period for earnings.


In comparison, the same measure for market leader InterGlobe Aviation Ltd, which runs IndiGo airlines, stood at 11.6 times.

Samsung plans to unveil the vertically folding phone late this year or early next year, and is using mock-ups to fine-tune the design, the people said.

"iPads have followed the same design ever since the first one came into existencea slate like design that can be held only with two hands, with a home button at the front and volume buttons on the side. It has mainly been an extension to the productivity of an iPhone.

The essence of the iPad will remain the same, albeit with a few changes, which have been long due now. The iPad might finally get FaceID, which means the omission of the iconic home button as well. As a result, the display can now stretch far more than the previous iterations. It will have the same firepower as the latest iPhonesan A12 bionic chipset.

"Clear History was first announced at last years F8, the companys event for developers and partners, in response to an outcry about data collection and privacy lapses on its sites. The tool still hasnt been launched, and it wasnt mentioned Tuesday. Late last year, Facebook admitted that Clear History is taking longer than expected  it turns out that browsing data, which the company uses to help send more targeted advertising to users on its social platforms  is more deeply ingrained into Facebooks systems than anyone realised. Simply finding and deleting the correct data without disrupting Facebooks advertising and analytics businesses has been a big enough challenge that the product hasnt gotten off the ground, although the company said earlier this month that the feature will debut this fall.


Its going to take time,"" Zuckerberg said of Facebooks privacy-focused future. Im sure were going to keep on unearthing old issues for a while, so it may feel like were not making progress at first. But I think that weve shown, time and again as a company, that we can do what it takes to evolve and build the products that people want.""


To be sure, these are challenging problems to unravel. Facebooks business was built on harvesting detailed user data to show people precisely targeted ads  not the kind of thing you simply undo overnight. Still, some privacy experts argue that the new announcements are little more than a veneer to assuage consumers, while changing little about its core business model.

A subsidiary of RPG Group, KEC International, is one of the leading engineering, procurement and construction companies in India. Its ability to estimate project cost at the time of bidding helped it win projects, deliver margins and mitigate risks. These estimates were based on the analysis of contour maps and physical surveys, which was both time-taking and prone to human errors. After trying out several alternatives, KEC decided to go with autonomous surveys using drones. Once the data was captured, it used image analytics, computer visions, and machine learning models to calculate excavation and backfilling of land. This allowed its bidding team to estimate project costs more accurately and this improved its bid-to-win ratio significantly. In terms of cost savings, the spending on excavation and backfilling quantity was reduced by up to 30%. Now KEC can survey 250 acres in five hours, which earlier took more than five days.

"Even as technology substitutes some forms of work, new types of work will be created. Photo: Aalok Soni/HT


India can create enough new jobs to offset automation and employ new entrants into the workforce, if it makes the required investments


A lip-reading system more proficient than a professional human lip-reader. An artificial intelligence (AI) system that can diagnose pneumonia from chest X-rays better than expert radiologists. These are just two real examples of how machine intelligence seems primed to substitute work activities that currently only humans can do. Looking ahead as technology progresses faster and faster, will human intelligence still be a useful resource? Will there really be enough work for humans to perform?


Some predict these technological trends to be catastrophic, culminating in mass unemployment. But our analysis suggest that the future of work can hold opportunity and the promise of more and better workprovided investment steps up, enabling growth in productivity, and the nation simultaneously gears up for workforce skill transitions.


First, it should be understood that not all human activities are easily automatable based on currently proven technologies. McKinsey Global Institutes (MGIs) analysis of more than 2,000 work activities across more than 800 occupations shows that automatable tasks include those done in predictable and structured environments, or involving routine data collection and data processing. But other activities will be much less susceptible to automation, such as managing teams, solving non-routine problems, and interfacing with stakeholders in unpredictable situations. Overall, about 30% of the time spent in most occupations could be technically automatedbut in only about 5% of occupations are nearly all activities automatable. The pace at which automation will be adopted depends on several factors besides technical feasibility. Among these are the cost of technology deployment, workforce quality and wages, and the benefits of technology beyond reducing costfor example, as a spur to innovation or quality.


Moreover, even as technology substitutes some forms of work, new types of work will be createdand this is not a new phenomenon. The introduction of the automobile created almost 7 million net new jobs in the US between 1910 and 1950, based on our estimates. It displaced workers who manufactured wagons, carriages, harnesses and saddles, as well as horse breeders and metal workers. But it created ten times as many jobs, in a host of new occupations: for workers in automotive supply chain, warehouses and logistics, auto dealerships, auto repair, gas stations, and convenience stores, amongst others.",even technology substitute form work new type work created photo aalok soniht india create enough new job offset automation employ new entrant workforce make required investment lipreading system proficient professional human lipreader artificial intelligence ai system diagnose pneumonia chest xrays better expert radiologist two real example machine intelligence seems primed substitute work activity currently human looking ahead technology progress faster faster human intelligence still useful resource really enough work human perform predict technological trend catastrophic culminating mass unemployment analysis suggest future work hold opportunity promise better workprovided investment step enabling growth productivity nation simultaneously gear workforce skill transition first understood human activity easily automatable based currently proven technology mckinsey global institutes mgis analysis 2000 work activity across 800 occupation show automatable task include done predictable structured environment involving routine data collection data processing activity much less susceptible automation managing team solving nonroutine problem interfacing stakeholder unpredictable situation overall 30 time spent occupation could technically automatedbut 5 occupation nearly activity automatable pace automation adopted depends several factor besides technical feasibility among cost technology deployment workforce quality wage benefit technology beyond reducing costfor example spur innovation quality moreover even technology substitute form work new type work createdand new phenomenon introduction automobile created almost 7 million net new job u 1910 1950 based estimate displaced worker manufactured wagon carriage harness saddle well horse breeder metal worker created ten time many job host new occupation worker automotive supply chain warehouse logistics auto dealership auto repair gas station convenience store amongst others,1
"While the damages awarded Friday arent significant to either company, from Qualcomms perspective, valuing just three of its more than 10,000 patents at $1.41 per phone shows the overall worth of its inventions. About 1.4 billion smartphones were sold last year, according to IDC.


In the broader licensing fight, Qualcomm has lost billions of dollars in revenue after Apple, through its Asian manufacturers, stopped paying patent royalties in 2017. The companies had a falling out in 2016 when Qualcomm -- which had been the exclusive supplier of iPhone chipsets for five years -- halted quarterly royalty rebates it had been paying Apple. The chipmaker has said it ended the rebates because Apple instigated antitrust investigations of Qualcomm and lied to regulators.


Apple has switched to using Intel Inc. chips in its phones.

"None of BJPs top leaders, including Modi, have made any mention about the temple in public meetings ever since elections were announced on 10 March. While Modi held a public meeting in Gosaiganj near Ayodhya on Wednesday, his larger pitch was development. Like in 2014, in this election too, the BJP has reiterated its commitment in its national manifesto to explore all possibilities within the Constitution to expedite the temple construction but its not talked about.


Naturally, the city is inseparable from the issue of the land dispute but no one wants clashes. For us here, development is what concerns us. We want better roads, infrastructure and access to services, and that is the crucial issue in this election,"" said Ismail Mohammad, who owns a bangle shop in Ayodhya. Were still lagging behind on development.""

In 2009 too, SP was in second place coming even closer to Congress Khatri with a margin of just 7%

"New breed of hackers: Hacking as we knew it has changed. While in the beginning it was the handiwork of overenthusiastic individuals honing their cyber-skills by finding loopholes in live systems, hackers today are financially motivated and run their operations under the aegis of organized criminal organizations, according to the 2019 Security Report by Checkpoint Software Technologies Ltd, released this month. The hacker arrested by the US department of justice in September 2018 for the WannaCry ransomware attack of 2017, for instance, was part of a criminal organization called the Lazarus Group with alleged links to the North Korean government.


Further, with more businesses moving their operations online, vast amounts of financial and critical business-related data is now stored in data centres. For cybercriminals, this is a huge opportunity as they can not only break into company systems and steal data but can take control and lock out the owners of their own systems. For instance, the Petya ransomware, which affected 2,000 enterprises in 65 countries, had locked users out of their own systems.


Hackers know what to target: According to Checkpoint, more than 10,000 different malicious files are detected per day while 700 malware families are being used on a daily basis. Initially, most of the ransomware attacks such as WannaCry and Petya didnt have any specific target. Cybercriminals have changed tactics and are now striking at their most vulnerable point of the target.",new breed hacker hacking knew changed beginning handiwork overenthusiastic individual honing cyberskills finding loophole live system hacker today financially motivated run operation aegis organized criminal organization according 2019 security report checkpoint software technology ltd released month hacker arrested u department justice september 2018 wannacry ransomware attack 2017 instance part criminal organization called lazarus group alleged link north korean government business moving operation online vast amount financial critical businessrelated data stored data centre cybercriminals huge opportunity break company system steal data take control lock owner system instance petya ransomware affected 2000 enterprise 65 country locked user system hacker know target according checkpoint 10000 different malicious file detected per day 700 malware family used daily basis initially ransomware attack wannacry petya didnt specific target cybercriminals changed tactic striking vulnerable point target,1

"Karnataka has a caste-centric political system with three major partiesBJP, Congress and JD(S). Voters tend to vote for a different party in the state and at the centre. While JD(S) has little presence outside the southern districts, BJP considers Mumbai-Karnataka and the coast its bastions. Though the Congress is the only party with a pan-Karnataka presence, its rocky equation with JD(S) could give BJP entry into regions in the south. The state is also divided based on regions. The south boasts of high industrial growth, better access to irrigation, IT and development, while the north has some of the most backward regions in India.


The Congress and JD(S) have a state-level alliance and are jointly contesting the Lok Sabha polls as well. JD(S) relies on votes from the Vokkaliga community, while BJP believes it enjoys the support of the upper caste Lingayats.

"That would mean a blotch on the central banks record of not keeping inflation at or above 2%, which is of course ironic for a country once threatened by high inflation. The MPCs mandate is 2-6% inflation range, with 4% as the mid-point target to achieve on an enduring basis.


But what tilted the odds to the rate cut were inflationary expectations. Indians now expect inflation to be benign as the central banks survey of households revealed. Households expectations on inflation in the next three months have fallen by 80 basis points (bps) and for the next one year by 130 bps, said RBI. A basis point is 0.01%.


This is music to a central banks ears, siSarvesh Kumar Sharma/Mintnce monetary policy targets inflation expectations. The revision in the headline inflation forecast for the entire 2019 was a massive 60 bps, with RBIs models forecasting that inflation would be at best 3.9% by the end of this year.

"The Congress, on the other hand, is trying to reposition itself as the main opposition party, having suffered a humiliating rout in 2014. It is trying to bring some focus on plummeting farm incomes and the lack of employment opportunities for the youngsters joining the labour force . The party is hoping to leverage the deep disgruntlement among farmers (most of whom have seen their incomes stagnate) and unemployed youth. Unsurprisingly, its manifesto devotes the first chapter to jobs.


In reality, economic hardships have exacerbated over the past three years and both parties make extra efforts to appear sympathetic. Both are relying on their individual versions of social welfare schemes and safety nets to appeal to the voter. One welfare schemecash transfershas caught the fancy of both parties, adding custom-built bells and whistles. A basic guaranteed income has been promised, with clear targeting.


This is where lines both diverge and converge, contradictory as it might sound. Both parties have avowedly different ideologies but seem to cohere to a broadly common economic programme which cedes primacy to the market and re-imagines an expanded role for Indias private sector alongside a shrinking role for the state.


The cash transfer scheme is a back-handed acknowledgement of failure to reform the economy, abolish poverty, reduce inequality or sort out the structural issues that keep the economy from achieving its full potential. Instead of fixing the deep-rooted troubles (such as eliminating entrenched vote banks that deny farmers their rightful income) and investing in robust primary education and healthcare infrastructure, both parties have opted for the easier route of throwing around somebody elses money.",congress hand trying reposition main opposition party suffered humiliating rout 2014 trying bring focus plummeting farm income lack employment opportunity youngster joining labour force party hoping leverage deep disgruntlement among farmer seen income stagnate unemployed youth unsurprisingly manifesto devotes first chapter job reality economic hardship exacerbated past three year party make extra effort appear sympathetic relying individual version social welfare scheme safety net appeal voter one welfare schemecash transfershas caught fancy party adding custombuilt bell whistle basic guaranteed income promised clear targeting line diverge converge contradictory might sound party avowedly different ideology seem cohere broadly common economic programme cedes primacy market reimagines expanded role indias private sector alongside shrinking role state cash transfer scheme backhanded acknowledgement failure reform economy abolish poverty reduce inequality sort structural issue keep economy achieving full potential instead fixing deeprooted trouble eliminating entrenched vote bank deny farmer rightful income investing robust primary education healthcare infrastructure party opted easier route throwing around somebody elses money,0

"The silvery-white metal has more than tripled since January 2016, and Citigroup Inc. said this month that further gains may be in store, warning the market will only balance with a shock to demand and prices may hit $1,600. The global deficit looks set to widen dramatically"" this year, according to Johnson Matthey Plc, a leading maker of autocatalysts, and BlackRock Inc.s Evy Hambro told Bloomberg TV this week that a massive shortage"" has built up as the auto market moves away from diesel-powered vehicles.


Until you get an increase in supply coming onstream, which isnt going to happen for a few years yet, this is going to result in a tight market and prices generally trending higher,"" Philip Klapwijk, managing director of Hong Kong-based consultant Precious Metals Insights Ltd., said on Wednesday.


Tighter supplies of the metal, used mainly to curb emissions in gasoline vehicles, have prompted users to lease material from exchange-traded fund holders to meet their needs. Heraeus, a refiner, said physical palladium ETF holdings fell to 700,000 ounces at the end of 2018, down from a peak of 2.9 million in 2014. Its hard to gauge the exact level of global stockpiles, but various sources have estimated a range between 10 million and 18 million ounces, which equates to roughly one to two years of demand, Heraeus said.


Still, some analysts are questioning the durability of the rally. Car sales in China continued to drop in January after their first full-year slump in more than two decades.

"Researchers are increasingly striving to help machines translate words from one language to another the way professional translators would. This implies that machines must understand the context of words and sentences, and make sense of idioms, phrases and jokes.


However, despite the fact that billions of words are being translated daily by multilingual machine translation services such as Google Translate, Microsoft Translator and Systrans Pure Neural Machine Translator, machines have a long way to go before they can function as fluently as humans do.


The Dartmouth research team saw in the Bible a large, previously untapped data set of aligned parallel text (or translation/s)"", according to a 23 October press statement by the university. For instance, each version of the Bible contains more than 31,000 verses that the researchers used to produce over 1.5 million unique pairings of source and translated verses for machine learning training sets.


According to the research published in the journal Royal Society Open Science, this is not the first parallel data set created for style translation. But it is the first that uses the Bible. Other texts that have been used in the past, ranging from Shakespeare to Wikipedia entries, provide data sets that are either much smaller or not as well suited for the task of translation.",researcher increasingly striving help machine translate word one language another way professional translator would implies machine must understand context word sentence make sense idiom phrase joke however despite fact billion word translated daily multilingual machine translation service google translate microsoft translator systrans pure neural machine translator machine long way go function fluently human dartmouth research team saw bible a large previously untapped data set aligned parallel text translation according 23 october press statement university instance version bible contains 31000 verse researcher used produce 15 million unique pairing source translated verse machine learning training set according research published journal royal society open science first parallel data set created style translation first us bible text used past ranging shakespeare wikipedia entry provide data set either much smaller well suited task translation,1

"The Fourth Industrial Revolution (i4.0) could transform the way we live and work  presenting both opportunities and challenges. It could lead India into the arc of global progress; entrepreneurs, CEOs, leaders, and start-ups are rapidly adopting technologies involving AI, the Internet of Things (IoT), 3D-printing, advanced robotics and neuroscience.


In this context, it is gratifying that KPMG in Indias survey of Indian CEOs showed that more than 90% of them see technology disruption as more of an opportunity than a threat. This i4 openness is what makes India stand out as an emerging economy.


So what will the Fourth Industrial Revolution mean for India? Among the many important aspects of i4.0 is the confluence of interconnected technologies that enables new approaches to multiple issues such as energy access, food security and building efficiencies. Mobility is expected to witness exponential growth; a leading cab aggregator is already working on air taxis and drones are being used across industries to identify and monitor work. Such advanced tech interventions will enhance pan-industrial functioning and processes.


Gartner says a 30-fold increase in connected devices will significantly alter how the supply chain operates. Global firms recognise IoTs transformational role, particularly in manufacturing, retailing and service industries.

The BJP will look to make up for a likely shortfall in Rajasthan, MP and Chhattisgarh in West Bengal, Odisha and the Northeast


Also, as compared to 2014, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka will have a greater significance for BJP and Congress in Elections 2019


MUMBAI: Mumbai: Lok Sabha Elections 2019, dates of which were announced Sunday, will be contested in territories that could be called the battleground states. These are not only states which choose themselves for their size and significance, such as Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, but also smaller ones that will play an outsized role.


The party or alliance that wins Elections 2019 is going to be determined by the states that are not necessarily big but which nevertheless can swing the outcome in terms of the arithmetic of alliances and the competing narratives that have dominated the post-2014 landscape, such as Kerala, Tamil Nadu and the northeastern states.


West Bengal too assumes a greater significance for Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the main challengerthe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)this year than it did in 2014.

Not making an Android version of the TV app ignores on hundreds of millions of potential paying viewers, especially outside the US.

"On Wednesday, Cook announced a potential drop of 25% in sales in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan in the most recent quarter. A sharp falloff like that suggests that Chinese consumers are following a trend in other emerging markets like India and Indonesia, where consumers have long passed over iPhones for cheaper, almost-as-good devices from Apples competitors.


People arent buying iPhones like they used to. With smartphones now in nearly every pocket in the developed world, new customers are hard to come by. So Apple has increasingly relied on enticing existing customers to toss their old iPhones for faster, slimmer, pricier successors.


Cook said this week that customers are waiting longer to replace their iPhones, with many instead swapping in new batteries to extend their life. Apple fuelled that trend when it cut the price of battery swaps to $29 from $79 in response to revelations that its software slowed down iPhones with old batteries.


That presents a dilemma for Cook. Apple wants iPhones to be durable and long-lasting so consumers will see them as worthy investments. (Many now cost more than a refrigerator.) Apple also knows that the longer consumers use their iPhone, the more they pay for apps and Apple services, a rapidly growing and increasingly important part of Apples business.


Apples sophisticated supply chain is among the great wonders of modern business, incorporating hundreds of suppliers in a complex web of factories and shippers to keep up with global demand for one of historys most popular products. And Cook, who was Apples operations guru before he became chief executive, is largely credited with its creation.


But it soon might be in Trumps cross hairs. Apple, one of the quintessential American brands, assembles most of its products in China  and Trump has noticed. He criticized Apple on the campaign trail, saying hed force it to start making its products closer to home. While president, he has said Apple plans to build a lot of plants"" in the United States  even though it hasnt announced plans to do so. (Cook hasnt publicly corrected him.)


While Apple avoided an iPhone tax in the first rounds of tariffs, it might not be so lucky if Trump is looking for more products to target. If that happens, Apple will be in a pickle. Its supply chain is entrenched in China, and finding another country that can match Chinas scale and skill in the labour market will be difficult. The iPhone is also already among the worlds most expensive phones. Increasing the price to pay for tariffs would most likely scare away even more buyers.",wednesday cook announced potential drop 25 sale china hong kong taiwan recent quarter sharp falloff like suggests chinese consumer following trend emerging market like india indonesia consumer long passed iphones cheaper almostasgood device apples competitor people arent buying iphones like used smartphones nearly every pocket developed world new customer hard come apple increasingly relied enticing existing customer toss old iphones faster slimmer pricier successor cook said week customer waiting longer replace iphones many instead swapping new battery extend life apple fuelled trend cut price battery swap 29 79 response revelation software slowed iphones old battery present dilemma cook apple want iphones durable longlasting consumer see worthy investment many cost refrigerator apple also know longer consumer use iphone pay apps apple service rapidly growing increasingly important part apples business apples sophisticated supply chain among great wonder modern business incorporating hundred supplier complex web factory shipper keep global demand one historys popular product cook apples operation guru became chief executive largely credited creation soon might trumps cross hair apple one quintessential american brand assembles product china  trump noticed criticized apple campaign trail saying hed force start making product closer home president said apple plan to build lot plant united state  even though hasnt announced plan cook hasnt publicly corrected apple avoided iphone tax first round tariff might lucky trump looking product target happens apple pickle supply chain entrenched china finding another country match chinas scale skill labour market difficult iphone also already among worlds expensive phone increasing price pay tariff would likely scare away even buyer,1

"It just absolutely baffles me that if I wanted to completely get rid of Facebook that it essentially would still be on my phone, which brings up more questions,"" Winke said in an interview. Can they still track your information, your location, or whatever else they do? We the consumer should have say in what we want and dont want on our products.""


Consumers have become more alert about their digital rights and more vigilant about privacy in the past year, following revelations about Facebooks information-sharing practices and regulators heightened scrutiny of online data collection. Some people have deleted their Facebook accounts in protest of the companys lapses, while others simply want to make sure they have the option to do so. Many Android phone users have begun to question Samsungs deal to sell phones with a permanent version of Facebook -- and some of them are complaining on social media.


A Facebook spokesperson said the disabled version of the app acts like its been deleted, so it doesnt continue collecting data or sending information back to Facebook. But theres rarely communication with the consumer about the process. The Menlo Park, California-based company said whether the app is deletable or not depends on various pre-install deals Facebook has made with phone manufacturers, operating systems and mobile operators around the world over the years, including Samsung. Facebook, the worlds largest social network, wouldnt disclose the financial nature of the agreements, but said theyre meant to give the consumer the best"" phone experience right after opening the box.


Balwinder Singhs experience wasnt what he would consider the best. Singh, who lives in the Susquehanna Valley of the eastern US and works in transportation, bought his Samsung phone seven months ago. He first tried to delete the Facebook app when he was setting up the device.


My news feed was full of negative stuff, people going crazy on social media,"" he said. It was affecting me emotionally and mentally.""

"Samsung forecasts production of at least 1 million foldable phones this year. The launch of the device comes as the worlds biggest phone maker tries to lure back consumers who have become used to incremental upgrades and are being wooed by Chinese manufacturers lower-priced smartphones.


Samsung, which also produces memory chips and televisions, makes the foldable displays itself and supplies technology to rivals such as Apple. The South Korean company shipped 291.3 million phones last year while Huawei sold 205.8 million, according to Strategy Analytics. Samsung will probably sell more than 40 million units of its flagship Galaxy S10 in the first year of release, according to Counterpoint.

"Call it developmentan election battle cry first popularized way back in the 1990s by Gadkari, then a member of state legislative council who was so obsessed with flyovers that he would go on to build 50-plus of them in Mumbai alone when he became the public works minister in the Shiv Sena-BJP government in 1995. Now hes joined in by Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, a local lad who is fast emerging as a new power centre in the post-2014 growth story of the BJP and the Sangh Parivar. Gadkari, once his mentor, is today seeing a new challenge in Fadnavis.


New Nagpur with all its good and bad bears a Gadkari-Fadnavis signature, a marked departure from the waves of transformations of the past. The plan, according to the Nagpur Metro Rail Corporation Ltd, is to build big towers along the metro routes by giving higher floor space index (FSI), and in return increasing the resources from the real estate 500 metres on either side of the metro corridor.


Nagpurians doubt if we could ever bring in such businesses, though an Oxford Economics report pitted Nagpur to be among the 20 fastest growing cities in the world from 2019-35. Nagpur is an education and a medical hub; an economy driven by services, small enterprise and trading, and regional government offices.


It began with a handful of few young men. In the dusty by-lanes of Mahal, the old town, Keshav Baliram Hedgewar formed a small group of swayamsevaks (volunteers) who would build one of Indias biggest socio-cultural and political organizations, the RSSthe right wing behemoth that reigns over the country today through its political arm, the BJP. For decades, while the RSS shakhas proliferated across the city, its political arm, the Jan Sangh and later the BJP, remained on the fringes.


The Sangh is not a political organization, it is an organization of the entire Hindu society, and the society is a complex function,"" veteran Sangh ideologue M.G. alias Baburao Vaidya says. The RSS volunteers gradually entered into many domains of the society, including politics, so if your gauge is only politics, you will falter in understanding the Sangh,"" he says at his modest house. Its the soul."" Vaidya, who started as a volunteer early on in his life, has seen both, Nagpur and the RSS expand over time. At 96, he has limited mobility, but is still sharp with his memory.


Notwithstanding a stern opposition to their ideology in the early part of the Sangh journey, it was the ideologues and volunteers like Vaidya, who steadfastly worked for its propagation. Todays BJP and the RSS is the creation of that unflinching foundational work, he suggests.


Some people started working on students issues, others entered politics, some others started working in the field of religion to form the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), late Dattopant Thengadi formed a trade union and a farmers organization; Ekal Vidyalaya got started in remote parts, there is one organization that works among the lawyers, other on culture,"" he says. Today there are about 36 such entities that work in different spheres but because politics gains prominence the BJP gets the limelight.""


The RSS phenomenal expansion and its volunteers steadfast loyalty helps the BJP and its leaders, he says. Nagpur too, isnt an exception. The country-wide rise of the BJP and the Sangh Parivar and the waning of the Congress and its moral compass has altered even Nagpurs political landscape.


If the RSS was formed here, Nagpur was also where Dr B.R. Ambedkar embraced Buddhism along with thousands of his Scheduled Caste supporters at Deekshabhoomi in what remains the only democratic example of a bloodless conversion, a revolution against caste discrimination that continues to hold promise of an equal society for all those who experienced untouchability. It was a thought that revolted against the RSS idea of Hindutva. Much of Maharashtras Scheduled Caste intellectual movement got traction from here. It still remains the epicentre of the Ambedkarite movement on the one hand and RSS on the other. Historically and ontologically, the two thoughts remain antithetical to each other.


Nagpur always had staunch left, right and centrist movements, but never had animosities between them,"" remembers N.D. Khare, author and proprietor of one of the regions oldest construction firms. There was always a bonhomie between various thinkers, something that we have lost today."" Nagpur took pride in towering and erudite academicians, painters and musicians, and of course poets and writers. Suresh Bhat, Manik Godghate alias Grace, Mahesh Elkunchwar the list is long.


Politically, despite being the RSS headquarter and epicentre of Ambedkars Republican movement, Nagpur always remained centrist and deeply seculara character that is perceptibly changing. In this context, 2019 has much at stake for Nagpur.


Will Nitin Jairam Gadkari defy history to win a second term from Nagpur as a Lok Sabha member? Nagpur goes to polls in the first phase. Over 2.1 million voters will cast their vote on 11 April. He has huge personal stakes in the coming general elections. Some of his ideas are untested. Some of his pet-projects are half way through.

"Critical underwater infrastructure are not being inspected on time because of the harsh and dangerous environment in which the divers have to go and do inspections,"" says Rohith Surendran, marketing manager, IROV Technologies.

IROVs data analytics and visualization tools provide a user-friendly report.

Once a merchant transmits a bill amount and transaction details, customers can initiate contactless payment through their smartphone.

"HMD Global-owned Nokia launched the X7 in China last month. With prices starting at 1,699 Yuan (about ? 18,000) for the base 4GB/64GB variant, the phone sports a 6.18-inch display and a unique Snapdragon 710 processor. As expected, the Nokia X7 will make its way to India by the last week of November and will be named the Nokia 8.1 instead of Nokia 7.1 Plus.


The Nokia 7.1 Plus sports a 6.18-inch Full HD+ LCD display at the front. From the first look at the official images released by Nokia, it is hard to not appreciate how far off to the edges Nokia has stretched the screen. Powering the device is a rather unique Snapdragon 710 processor clocked at 2.2GHz with eight Kryo 360 cores. It comes in three variants of 4GB RAM/64GB internal storage, 6GB RAM/64GB internal storage and 6GB RAM/128GB internal storage.",hmd globalowned nokia launched x7 china last month price starting 1699 yuan 18000 base 4gb64gb variant phone sport 618inch display unique snapdragon 710 processor expected nokia x7 make way india last week november named nokia 81 instead nokia 71 plus nokia 71 plus sport 618inch full hd lcd display front first look official image released nokia hard appreciate far edge nokia stretched screen powering device rather unique snapdragon 710 processor clocked 22ghz eight kryo 360 core come three variant 4gb ram64gb internal storage 6gb ram64gb internal storage 6gb ram128gb internal storage,1
"But an analysis of the companies shows startups working on truly innovative problems constitute less than a tenth of these companies.


Most of the funds (and noise) is soaked up by startups engaged in one of two things. The first, on-demand and e-commerce platforms, find new ways to order things without leaving your couch. The other class of startups, social media and entertainment firms, are focused on designing content that keeps you in that couch for as long as possible.


Take on-demand firms. Uber has improved the taxi-hailing experience; WeWork has made renting office space easy; and with Swiggy, its nice not to have to walk to the restaurant for food. But we are still riding in the same taxi, working in the same office, and eating from the same restaurant as before. The order-to-fulfilment process has been streamlined and the supply more closely matches demand. But this isnt innovation that has fundamentally altered how we live, work, or play. Its just made it incrementally better.


The desire to disrupt any activity with on-demand or online substitutes can sometimes veer into the absurd. Early last year, SoftBanks Vision Fund invested $300 million into Wag, a startup that lets you book a dog walker. (The Vision Funds stated goal is to invest in businesses and foundational platforms that will enable the next age of innovation"".)


With social media companies, the innovation argument is even weaker. Facebook and Google evangelised the cult of connectivity. But after the initial productivity gains from improved communication, watching YouTube videos, sharing Google photos or browsing Facebook are not growth-accelerating. On the contrary, the fatigue induced by aimless scrolling on Twitter or WhatsApp are a drain on productivity.


For an industry that fetishizes disruption and innovation, this lack of creativity is disappointing. One reason for this state of affairs could be financial. The computer scientist Jaron Lanier has argued that the monetization model driving the internet has created perverse incentives for tech companies.


From the early days of the internet, we assumed that most of the content and services should be free. But the desire to democratize access to information came at a cost the advertising-supported business model. The largest tech companies todayFacebook and Googlerely on advertising for a majority of their revenue. Even Amazon has now got into the game, by selling pixels on its site to eager sellers.


In the push to generate more advertising revenue, these companies need to continually find ways to keep users addicted (or engaged) to their platform. And as users have become smarter, the algorithms have become even more intricate.


Today, some of the largest employers of A.I. and machine-learning talent are social media platforms. ByteDance, the creator of Tik Tok and the most valuable startup on the planet, employs legions of AI and machine-learning engineers. Tik Tok does a great job of curating and customizing content, based on whats most likely to appeal to a user. But peel away the glamour and the product is still a social network for amateur music videos.",analysis company show startup working truly innovative problem constitute less tenth company fund noise soaked startup engaged one two thing first ondemand ecommerce platform find new way order thing without leaving couch class startup social medium entertainment firm focused designing content keep couch long possible take ondemand firm uber improved taxihailing experience wework made renting office space easy swiggy its nice walk restaurant food still riding taxi working office eating restaurant ordertofulfilment process streamlined supply closely match demand isnt innovation fundamentally altered live work play its made incrementally better desire disrupt activity ondemand online substitute sometimes veer absurd early last year softbanks vision fund invested 300 million wag startup let book dog walker vision funds stated goal invest business foundational platform enable next age innovation social medium company innovation argument even weaker facebook google evangelised cult connectivity initial productivity gain improved communication watching youtube video sharing google photo browsing facebook growthaccelerating contrary fatigue induced aimless scrolling twitter whatsapp drain productivity industry fetishizes disruption innovation lack creativity disappointing one reason state affair could financial computer scientist jaron lanier argued monetization model driving internet created perverse incentive tech company early day internet assumed content service free desire democratize access information came cost the advertisingsupported business model largest tech company todayfacebook googlerely advertising majority revenue even amazon got game selling pixel site eager seller push generate advertising revenue company need continually find way keep user addicted engaged platform user become smarter algorithm become even intricate today largest employer ai machinelearning talent social medium platform bytedance creator tik tok valuable startup planet employ legion ai machinelearning engineer tik tok great job curating customizing content based whats likely appeal user peel away glamour product still social network amateur music video,1

"This move also comes a day after Sebi published a discussion paper which proposed price bands for future and options (F&O) stocks.

Of these, 29 saw intra-day movements of 20-30%. Five stocks moved between 30% and 40% and six moved more than 40%.


One solution proposed by Sebi is introducing a 20% price band for all stocks including ones on which derivatives are available. However, this could pose difficulties as F&O stocks have enhanced eligibility criteria.


Another way is to use a mix of dynamic and fixed price bands. The current framework for dynamic price band may be allowed to continue with the initial threshold set by the stock exchanges,"" said the paper. However, this framework would be available up to a threshold of 30% of intraday movement, after which a fixed price band on the stock may be imposed or a call auction held for a fixed duration, Sebi said.",move also come day sebi published discussion paper proposed price band future option fo stock sebi discussion paper said observed high level volatility fo stock past six month forty scrip witnessed intraday movement 20 29 saw intraday movement 2030 five stock moved 30 40 six moved 40 one solution proposed sebi introducing 20 price band stock including one derivative available however could pose difficulty fo stock enhanced eligibility criterion another way use mix dynamic fixed price band the current framework dynamic price band may allowed continue initial threshold set stock exchange said paper however framework would available threshold 30 intraday movement fixed price band stock may imposed call auction held fixed duration sebi said,3

"Whatever federal privacy law eventually emerges is expected to be less stringent than the California measure and to supersede it. As a result, the tech industry is trying to help shape any national restrictions.


""This is the first time ever that the industry wants legislation,"" said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a privacy advocacy group. ""The industry is terrified.""


On Tuesday, a House committee will press Google and Facebook executives about another urgent concern involving Big Tech: Whether they're doing enough to curb the spread of hate crimes and white nationalism through online platforms. The Judiciary Committee hearing follows a series of violent incidents fueled in part by online communication.


Facebook, used by 2-billion-plus people including over 200 million in the US, has been a particular lightning rod for industry critics. Having had its reputation tarnished over data privacy lapses, a tide of hate speech and a spread of disinformation that allowed Russian agents to target propaganda campaigns, Facebook appears ready to embrace a national privacy law.


Facebook's founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, published a column last month in the Washington Post calling for tighter regulations to protect consumer data, control harmful content and ensure election integrity and data portability.


Amazon says it has built its business on protecting people's information, ""and we have been working with policymakers on how best to do that.""


""There is real momentum to develop baseline rules of the road for data protection,"" Google's chief privacy officer, Keith Enright, has said in a policy paper. ""Google welcomes this and supports comprehensive, baseline privacy regulation.""


A sweeping ""privacy shield"" law in the European Union, covering how tech companies handle personal data in the 28-country bloc, should be a model, Zuckerberg wrote. EU regulators recently fined Google $1.7 billion for freezing out rivals in the online ad business  their third penalty against the search giant in two years. The EU watchdogs have also ordered Apple and Amazon to pay back taxes and fined Facebook for providing misleading information in its acquisition of WhatsApp.",whatever federal privacy law eventually emerges expected less stringent california measure supersede result tech industry trying help shape national restriction first time ever industry want legislation said jeffrey chester executive director center digital democracy privacy advocacy group industry terrified tuesday house committee press google facebook executive another urgent concern involving big tech whether theyre enough curb spread hate crime white nationalism online platform judiciary committee hearing follows series violent incident fueled part online communication facebook used 2billionplus people including 200 million u particular lightning rod industry critic reputation tarnished data privacy lapse tide hate speech spread disinformation allowed russian agent target propaganda campaign facebook appears ready embrace national privacy law facebooks founder ceo mark zuckerberg published column last month washington post calling tighter regulation protect consumer data control harmful content ensure election integrity data portability amazon say built business protecting people information working policymakers best real momentum develop baseline rule road data protection google chief privacy officer keith enright said policy paper google welcome support comprehensive baseline privacy regulation sweeping privacy shield law european union covering tech company handle personal data 28country bloc model zuckerberg wrote eu regulator recently fined google 17 billion freezing rival online ad business  third penalty search giant two year eu watchdog also ordered apple amazon pay back tax fined facebook providing misleading information acquisition whatsapp,1

"Kaspersky Labs has also been on the trail of a cyber espionage operation run by an Arabic speaking cyber crime organisation, Gaza Cybergang.

However, most of them were located in Palestine, Jordan, Israel and Lebanon.


The researchers identified three different groups within the organisation with each showing a slightly different MO. SneakyPastes was the handiwork of one such sub-group called Mole Rats.


To avoid detection and hide the location of the command and control server, the hackers would download an additional malware on the targeted devices via free sites, including Pastebin and Github. In the final stage, a Remote Access Trojan was installed on the device, which opened a backdoor with their command and control server to steal, encrypt and upload information from the targeted device.",kaspersky lab also trail cyber espionage operation run arabic speaking cyber crime organisation gaza cybergang known sneakypastes operation used malicious email domain carry phishing attack 240 highprofile individual embassy medium house political party government agency bank 39 country however located palestine jordan israel lebanon researcher identified three different group within organisation showing slightly different mo sneakypastes handiwork one subgroup called mole rat avoid detection hide location command control server hacker would download additional malware targeted device via free site including pastebin github final stage remote access trojan installed device opened backdoor command control server steal encrypt upload information targeted device,1
"I am blown away,"" said Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights and Strategy, adding that the phone could help Samsung rejuvenate its mobile business, whose lead is under attack from Chinas Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd.


I believe you can innovate your way out of a mature market,"" he said, noting that when Apple launched the iPhone in 2007, most industry watchers believed that the market had matured for $100 candy bar"" phones without touchscreens.


Bob ODonnell of TECHnalysis Research said that the work Samsung had done with Facebook Inc., Alphabet Inc.s Google and Microsoft Corp. to adapt applications to the new screen was important.


He said that though Samsung had teased the folding phone before, to see it in action, to see the softwareI was like, wow. Its hugely important that the software experience be good"".


The Galaxy Fold, which can operate three apps simultaneously and boasts six cameras, also challenges the notion of what a phone can cost, debuting at nearly twice the price of current top-of-the-line models from Apple and Samsung itself.


Due to price, its likely to be sold mainly to early adopters. Prices are key to expanding sales,"" said former Samsung mobile executive Kim Yong-serk, who is now a professor at Sungkyunkwan University in Korea. It will help Samsung burnish an image as an innovative company, but it is unlikely to be profitable.

"Facebook accepted the mistake but said the passwords were never visible to anyone outside of Facebook. Users can check which of their accounts or passwords have been compromised on sites like haveibeenpwned.com, created by Hunt.


Google recently added a password checkup extension for Chrome, which can tell which will tell users which of their usernames and passwords have been compromised and need to be changed.


Two-factor authentication has emerged as the second line of defence to passwords. After punching in their password, users are required to verify the sign in process using one-time password (OTP) sent through SMS, a six-digit code generated through apps like Google Authenticator, or through a small USB device like Google Titan Security Key or Yubico FIDO U2F Security key. This last step requires users to plug in the USB dongle into the PC and then type the specific code only they would know.

"Maintaining a strong password is not a single step solution. Users need to keep various things in mind to keep passwords strong.


According to McAfee Labs, in addition to using long and complex passwords comprising a random set of symbols, numbers and letters, specific to each account, users also need to keep security software up to date to avoid keylogger attacks, avoid signing into accounts on public computers or on their personal devices using public WiFi. A keylogger is malicious software that can track your keystrokes.


Complex passwords can be hard to remember. This is where password managers like LastPass and Keeper can come in handy. These solutions keep all complex passwords in an encrypted format and users can access them all with one master password. Besides the master password, some of the solutions use multi-factor authentication and sign-in forms.


While users should regularly update their passwords, keeping an eye on the passwords that might have been compromised in a data breach might help too. In March, Faceboook was accused by an independent cybersecurity expert for storing millions of passwords in plain text format on its internal servers. These passwords could be seen by anyone with access to these servers.",maintaining strong password single step solution user need keep various thing mind keep password strong according mcafee lab addition using long complex password comprising random set symbol number letter specific account user also need keep security software date avoid keylogger attack avoid signing account public computer personal device using public wifi keylogger malicious software track keystroke complex password hard remember password manager like lastpass keeper come handy solution keep complex password encrypted format user access one master password besides master password solution use multifactor authentication signin form user regularly update password keeping eye password might compromised data breach might help march faceboook accused independent cybersecurity expert storing million password plain text format internal server password could seen anyone access server,1

"However, you need good headphones (though it covers impedance as low as 8 ohm), a well-tuned ear and good music files to really take advantage of this.

You will likely feel this if youre a bass-head and want more powerful, booming bass. Thats where the M0 is slightly weak, in terms of audio quality. Highs and mids sound quite sharp.

"A template to view Elections 2019 with numbers that can help navigate the eight weeks of election campaign ahead


New Delhi: In the summer of 2014, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) staked claim to form a government in Delhi by sweeping India's Hindi heartland. The party won nearly 90% of its seats from just five states in north and central India. Five years down the line, the Congress has swept back to power in assembly elections held in several of those states. The BJP has also witnessed a reversal in vote share in state legislative seats which fall within parliamentary constituencies the party won for the first time ever in 2014.


Under the changed circumstances, will the BJP look beyond the Hindi heartland and build new strongholds in South India and East India? Will an unlikely third-front alliance materialize by 23 May? Will Rahul Gandhi manage to make a dent on Narendra Modi's enduring popularity? The stage is set and the battle lines are drawn.

"Under the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a landmark privacy law adopted last year, individuals have the right to get a copy of their data held by internet companies, or ask that it be deleted.


But the legislation is no help in inheritance matters, as it applies only to the living, bequeathing no rights to their heirs, said Rowenna Fielding, a data protection expert at British consultancy Protecture.


This is partly because, unlike the United States, the leading legal view in Europe is that personal data is not a type of property and as such cannot be sold or disposed of, legal experts said.


""The only owner of the personal data is the individual,"" said Gabriel Voisin, a partner specialising in data protection and privacy at international law firm Bird & Bird.


Personal data refers to any information relating to a person's identity, like their name, address or religion.


""Organisations may receive this information because I provided them with it ... but they are not (the) owners of my name. They are instead what we call 'custodians' of the information,"" Voisin said.

On jobs front, PM Narendra Modi says India could not have notched up its fast pace of GDP growth without employment generation


New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday made a strong defence of his governments controversial move to demonetise high-value currencies and its record in job creation. Demonetisation, he said in a wide-ranging interview with Hindustan, was launched in national interest, not for political gain"". On the jobs front, Modi said India could not have notched up its fast pace of GDP growth without employment generation and that 60 million jobs have been created in micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) alone in the last four years. Edited excerpts:


It had been a very satisfactory and extremely good five years. My experience in these five years boosted my belief that there is no reason why India should remain in the category of developing countries.


We have all the capabilities to be a developed country. This conviction will continue to be of great help to take the country ahead in the next five years.


When I came here, the situation was much worse than what I have thought it would be. It was a terrible situation. I was new to this place and I also had to understand issues, but as we started taking decisions, several worrying things came up.


My long experience as chief minister helped me to remain confident, and I knew that we would find ways, and we did find ways.


It would be difficult to restrict myself to this. Earlier, the government would beat its own drum throughout the year over one or two achievements. My case is such that if you take any ministry, any state or any development work, you can see a new initiative in it. There would've hardly been a day in these five years when an important decision was not taken or important work was not done.


So, there are so many achievements and initiatives, that to confine it to just three would be an injustice to other departments and my colleagues.


You made some promises when you assumed charge. Now that your first term is coming to an end, do you think you have not been able to complete the work you set out to?


If everything gets completed then I think that the world will come to a halt. One should look for new energy, ambitions and resolutions to move in life. The biggest satisfaction I get from my work is that it fuels my ambitions further to do many more new things.


You launched social schemes, such as 'Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao', 'Jan Dhan Yojana', 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyan' and the Mudra Scheme. You have spoken about social development in a committed manner. Are you happy with the results?


The train of Indias development runs on two tracks. One is the social infrastructure. Another, the physical infrastructure.


Keeping in mind the poorest of the poor, we must reach that social infrastructure level where everyone has house, education, health and toilet. Physical infrastructure should be world-class.


Look at the time of the independence struggle. The country was under occupation for many years. Every part of the country made sacrifices, but what did Gandhiji do? He changed the independence struggle into peoples movement: you take the broomsticks for independence, spin cotton for independence, you give adult education for independence, you teach for the purpose of independence. He added peoples participation to the freedom movement and changed the latters face.


I believe that development, like freedom struggle, should also be a peoples movement. We had previously considered limited programmes as adequate development, and this, I believe, used to be our strategic shortsightedness. If we had turned it into peoples movement, the results would have been hundred-fold.


I'm sure you know that when there was lesser number of currency notes with highest denomination of ?100 in India, Indira Gandhi had come up with a proposal (to demonetise). According to a book, Yashwantrao Chavan told her, Do you want to do politics or not? Do you want to fight elections or not? Dont fall in this trap.""


So, demonetisation might not have suit political arithmetic but for the national interest it had to be done. We did it for national interest, not for political gains.


Our steps against black money in the last four-and-a-half years have resulted in recovery of ?130,000 crore, which has been taxed and awarded penalties. Properties worth ?50,000 crores have been seized. During this period, ?6,900 crore of benami properties and assets in foreign shores worth ?1,600 crore have been also seized.


Nearly 338,000 shell companies have been identified and deregistered. Their directors have been disqualified. Its also due to demonetisation that tax compliance has almost doubled.


They (the opposition parties) did it earlier too. This did a lot of campaign in UP but they lost very badly. They got defeated over all the issues they tried to take to the people. It would have been a different thing if they had shown honesty and did some research.


You tell me, there were three lakh shell companies. Four hundred companies were running in such a small room (stretches his hand to show the size), hawala trade was going on...


Demonetisation had an impact on the hawala trade and terrorism. NIA investigations in Jammu and Kashmir showed that future funding for terror activities were cut off.


One of the criticisms often voiced is that demonetisation impacted employment. What is it that the government is doing on employment generation?


First of all, we have to understand the way employment data is collected in our country. For many years, we have been doing a sample survey and, on its basis, a minimum assumption is made. Lets look at some factsthis may or may not suit some people.",india effort make terrorism global agenda tell world pakistan business exporting terror india say pm narendra modi demonetisation might suit political arithmetic national interest political gain say pm narendra modi job front pm narendra modi say india could notched fast pace gdp growth without employment generation new delhi prime minister narendra modi friday made strong defence governments controversial move demonetise highvalue currency record job creation demonetisation said wideranging interview hindustan launched national interest political gain job front modi said india could notched fast pace gdp growth without employment generation 60 million job created micro small medium enterprise msmes alone last four year edited excerpt satisfactory extremely good five year experience five year boosted belief reason india remain category developing country capability developed country conviction continue great help take country ahead next five year came situation much worse thought would terrible situation new place also understand issue started taking decision several worrying thing came long experience chief minister helped remain confident knew would find way find way would difficult restrict earlier government would beat drum throughout year one two achievement case take ministry state development work see new initiative wouldve hardly day five year important decision taken important work done many achievement initiative confine three would injustice department colleague made promise assumed charge first term coming end think able complete work set everything get completed think world come halt one look new energy ambition resolution move life biggest satisfaction get work fuel ambition many new thing launched social scheme beti bachao beti padhao jan dhan yojana swachh bharat abhiyan mudra scheme spoken social development committed manner happy result train indias development run two track one social infrastructure another physical infrastructure keeping mind poorest poor must reach social infrastructure level everyone house education health toilet physical infrastructure worldclass look time independence struggle country occupation many year every part country made sacrifice gandhiji changed independence struggle peoples movement take broomstick independence spin cotton independence give adult education independence teach purpose independence added peoples participation freedom movement changed latters face believe development like freedom struggle also peoples movement previously considered limited programme adequate development believe used strategic shortsightedness turned peoples movement result would hundredfold im sure know lesser number currency note highest denomination 100 india indira gandhi come proposal demonetise according book yashwantrao chavan told do want politics want fight election dont fall trap demonetisation might suit political arithmetic national interest done national interest political gain step black money last fourandahalf year resulted recovery 130000 crore taxed awarded penalty property worth 50000 crore seized period 6900 crore benami property asset foreign shore worth 1600 crore also seized nearly 338000 shell company identified deregistered director disqualified its also due demonetisation tax compliance almost doubled opposition party earlier lot campaign lost badly got defeated issue tried take people would different thing shown honesty research tell three lakh shell company four hundred company running small room stretch hand show size hawala trade going demonetisation impact hawala trade terrorism nia investigation jammu kashmir showed future funding terror activity cut one criticism often voiced demonetisation impacted employment government employment generation first understand way employment data collected country many year sample survey basis minimum assumption made lets look factsthis may may suit people,0

"Spotify Technology SA and other technology giants appealed a ruling that increased the royalties they must pay to songwriters, a move that threatens to further damage the companies already-tenuous relationship with the music industry.


Songwriters celebrated last year when the Copyright Royalty Board ruled that they will get at least a 15.1% share of streaming revenues over the next five years, a raise from the previous rate of 10.5%.

"One of the main issues is the citizenship amendment bill, which was passed in the Lok Sabha. It will again come back,"" said Congress Chishi. Political parties from the North-East believe that the bill was at cross purposes with the National Register of Citizens, which seeks to wean out illegal Bangladeshi immigrants. Further, the BJP government wants to introduce a uniform civil code. It is dangerous. Once it is enshrined in the Constitution, the special protection to Nagas that Article 371 (A) provides will go.

"In 2014, BJP swept Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh. It retained Gujarat in the 2017 assembly elections, despite a spirited Congress performance. The Congress focus had shifted to the three other states that then were held by the BJP: Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Chhattisgarh, allowing the BJP to regroup in Gujarat.


A resurgent Congress that won these three states in 2018 remains a challenge for the BJP in Elections 2019. This also holds true for other Hindi-speaking states, where the BJP made big gains in 2014 but anti-incumbency could play a role in 2019.


The Congress, meanwhile, will look to do better than it did in 2014buoyed by its performance in the 2018 state elections.


As compared to 2014, a few southern states have a greater significance for the BJP and the Congress in Elections 2019. In Tamil Nadu, both the national parties have tied up with the two Dravidian regional powers. Kerala, the epicentre state of the Left vs Sangh battle, will witness another BJP bid, this time powered by the Sabarimala controversy, to not only retain the lone seat it won in 2014 but also make additional gains.


The Congress and Janata Dal (Secular), or JDS, which formed a post-poll alliance in Karnataka in 2018, will look to make Karnataka a test case for the opposition alliance. In 2014, the Congress won 10 Lok Sabha seats, the JDS 2 and the BJP 15.

Apple says it monitored some 2,500 people  measuring how they fell off ladders, missed a step while walking or got their legs caught in their pants while getting dressed. It used that data to separate real falls from other heavy wrist movements, such as clapping and hammering.


The feature will turn on automatically for users 65 and over; younger people can activate it in the settings. I can see kids buying one for their parents and grandparents,"" said analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights.


But the Apple Watch still lacks one feature found in rival wrist gadgets: the ability to analyse sleep quality. Battery life in the new watch remains at 18 hours, meaning it needs a daily  or nightly  recharge.

"The survey added that 97% IT managers admitted that security expertise is one of the greatest issues in India, and while 92% Indian IT managers wish they had a stronger team in place to properly detect, investigate and respond to security incidents, 89% believe cyber security recruitment is a challenge.


Almost three in four banks in Asia Pacific anticipate that fraud in their country will increase in 2019, said a new report by FICO on Tuesday. Of specific concern are transactions completed when neither the card nor the cardholder is physically present (card-not-present or CNP fraud), as well as cards taken out by criminals under false identities (application fraud), the report added.


Cybersecurity continues to be a major issue in India with 76.3% of organizations hit by cyber attacks in the last year, as compared to 68% organizations hit across the globe, a global survey from security firm Sophos corroborated.

On 13 March, security firm Seqrite--the enterprise arm of Quick Heal Technologies--said that in the second half of 2018, it detected close to 50 million threats targeting enterprises. This translates to around 186 detections every minute. These detections included known and unknown threats such as cryptojacking, ransomware, trojans, exploits, worms, infectors, potentially unwanted applications (PUAs), and adware.

"As far as Assam is concerned, the important ally, the AGP, did a flip-flop of walking out of the BJP on the CAB issue and then walking right back into the arms of the BJP. The AGPs image as a regional party which nurtured aspirations of the Assamese people after the anti-Bengali, anti-illegal immigrant movements of the late 1970s-80s has taken a huge beating. It is seen as an opportunistic party. It is unlikely that the AGP will win any of the 14 seats this time.


Understandably, the BJP has put up candidates in 13 out of 14 Lok Sabha seats. The party in its no-nonsense approach has axed five sitting MPs. Guwahati MP Bijoya Chakrabortys name has been set aside on account of her age (she is now 79 years), while sitting MPs Kamakhya Prasad Tasa and Ramen Deka have been dropped due to poor performance. Tezpur MP Ram Prasad Sarmah was axed after his name cropped up in the cash-for-jobs scam in which one of his daughters was involved. Sarmah had allegedly bribed the chairman of the Assam Public Service Commission along with many others to get his daughter selected in the Assam Police Service. Certainly, the BJP would not even touch Sarmah with a barge pole. The party seems serious about keeping its slate clean. Hence, Rajen Gohain, minister of state for railways who is allegedly involved in a case of rape and molestation has also been axed. Gohain tried to push his wifes name but to no avail. It appears that the BJP will also not entertain dynastic politics in the region.

Chishi, a former chief minister, are the two serious contenders. Political analysts are of the view that the sitting MP Yepthomi will return considering he has the support of Nagaland chief minister Neiphiu Rio and the BJP. Also, NDPPs bitter rival, the NPF, has not put up any candidate. Neither has the BJP which knows that it has to ride on its alliance partner, the NDPP.


As far as Manipur is concerned, the two Lok Sabha seats of Outer and Inner Manipur will see a fight between the BJP candidates and the main rival, the Congress. Earlier, both seats were held by the Congress. This time, the Congress has fielded two new facesO. Nabakishore Singh, former chief secretary of the state, and K. James, an entrepreneur. The party has dropped both sitting MPs. The BJP is fielding the partys state unit spokesperson R.K. Ranjan and partys state unit vice- president H. Shokhopao alias Benjamin Mate as candidates.


Interestingly, the NPP and the NPF, which are allies of the BJP in Manipur are both fielding candidates.

"The global consensus among experts is that 5G will truly become mainstream in 2020. But if that is to actually happen, 2019 will perhaps be the most crucial year for the next generation of wireless broadband technology. Companies like Ericsson have already started bringing their 5G products to India.


Moreover, while network equipment makers have been ready for a while, device makers are now pushing through. This month, Qualcomm unveiled its new mobile chipset, the Snapdragon 855, which will support 5G connectivity on mobile phones.


Edge Computing relates to both 5G and IoT. While 5G lowers the latency in networks, meaning data can travel faster between the servers and devices, edge computing takes care of the processing needs. This technology allows data to be processed closer to the source device, thereby making it easier for IoT devices to work on the fly.


Experts expect 2019 to have realistic implementations of smart cities, driverless cars and moreall of which requires edge computing. As 5G improves the network, edge computing is expected to augment the value that 5G brings.


Companies like IBM and D-Wave have broken ground in this field. IBM now has a a 50-qubit quantum computer. D-Waves machinewith its 2000 qubitsdoes not qualify to be a true quantum computer, mostly because its qubits are not built like those in traditional quantum computers, argue critics. Meanwhile, even Google, Microsoft and Intel have been working for quantum supremacy. This is a technology that will gain more maturity in 2019.

A lot of countries practice data localization and localize data very strictly. When you start moving away from critical personal data to strategic data, how local does that have to be? We have to see whether we can mirror that data and transport it to another jurisdiction, or whether we can create metadata and transport data, or transport non-critical data.

"Samsung was pushing to be the first to roll out flexible phones to the masses with pre-orders for the Fold  which sports a 7.3-inch screen when laid flat like a tablet  starting in mid-April. That would put it comfortably ahead of rivals, with Huawei planning a bendable-screen release as early as June while Xiaomi only unveiled its foldable prototypes earlier this year.


The Fold had began as a mere display panel project at Samsung. Considered a second-tier TV manufacturer until the 1990s, it rapidly evolved and began to challenge Apple in high-end smartphones around 2010. Yet it continued to battle perceptions of being a fast adopter"" rather than a true innovator: Apple sued Samsung in 2011 for slavishly"" copying the iPhones design, triggering a years-long legal battle.


It was around then that Samsung decided to draw on its decades-long prowess in screen technology to build an indisputably original product, and set itself apart. A phone that also unfolds into a tablet could open up a brand new market.


Initial prototypes would crack like a dried sheet of paper if folded about 10,000 times, people familiar with the matter said. Still, Samsung recognized its potential. It started to recruit mechanical engineers who could devote themselves to building a hinge the size of a finger, after the company realized the key to preventing cracks was to evenly distribute pressure. Engineers were encouraged to file as many patents as possible to prevent competition from creeping into a market that didnt exist at the time, the people said, asking not to be identified as they arent authorized to speak publicly.


All seemed on track till last week, when reports of damage to review models started to surface, from a malfunctioning screen after a thin film was peeled off to a display that flickered wildly. Samsung retrieved the units but initially maintained the product would launch as planned on April 26. On Monday, executives convened at their headquarters and debated for hours before finally pulling the plug, the people said.",samsung pushing first roll flexible phone mass preorders fold  sport 73inch screen laid flat like tablet  starting midapril would put comfortably ahead rival huawei planning bendablescreen release early june xiaomi unveiled foldable prototype earlier year fold began mere display panel project samsung considered secondtier tv manufacturer 1990s rapidly evolved began challenge apple highend smartphones around 2010 yet continued battle perception fast adopter rather true innovator apple sued samsung 2011 slavishly copying iphones design triggering yearslong legal battle around samsung decided draw decadeslong prowess screen technology build indisputably original product set apart phone also unfolds tablet could open brand new market initial prototype would crack like dried sheet paper folded 10000 time people familiar matter said still samsung recognized potential started recruit mechanical engineer could devote building hinge size finger company realized key preventing crack evenly distribute pressure engineer encouraged file many patent possible prevent competition creeping market didnt exist time people said asking identified arent authorized speak publicly seemed track till last week report damage review model started surface malfunctioning screen thin film peeled display flickered wildly samsung retrieved unit initially maintained product would launch planned april 26 monday executive convened headquarters debated hour finally pulling plug people said,1

The move comes amid a long-standing demand from opposition parties to increase the VVPAT count. It is also likely to make the counting process more transparent and boost voter confidence.

"India currently spends a little over 1% of its total GDP (gross domestic product) on healthcare, among the lowest healthcare spends in the world according to National Health Profile 2018 data. This isnt exclusive to India. Healthcare budgets around the world tend to be grossly inadequate.Quality healthcare is all about making the right decision at the right time,"" says Gupta. Even in the US, which has among the highest proportions of highly qualified medical specialists, human error is the third leading cause of death, according to a 2016 John Hopkins study. This is where technology will play another major role: in making healthcare safer. With big data and innovations in machine learning, many within the medical community are optimistic that technology will make healthcare safer.


Cancer remains one of the biggest killers in the world with the number of new cases each year projected to reach 23.6 million by 2030, according to International Agency for Research on Cancer. There is light at the end of the tunnel, says Geetha Manjunath, founder of Niramai, a healthtech startup leveraging an AI-driven solution that detects cancer and abnormalities.


Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in women. Today, only one in two women with breast cancer has a chance of survival. This is paradoxical given that breast cancer is completely curable,"" says Dr. Manjunath. Late detection and delayed check-ups are the biggest impediment in the battle against cancer. Early detection can be achieved by employing data-based decision-making. Data-based operations are far more scalable and efficient. That is what we are working towards,"" says Dr. Manjunath.


We are confident that with more specialty hospitals turning to data-driven solutions, the cost of cancer testing and treatment will reduce to about 1/6th of the present cost. Early diagnosis will become reality,"" she says.


Organizations like Niramai are making rapid strides in accuracy in medical decision-making. The early symptoms of most diseases tend to be similar, which means physicians dispense generic medication to most patients. Generic medication has its meritsits cheap and works well against common infections. But Indias dependency on mass-produced, easily available antibiotics is dangerous for public immunity. Prescribing generic medicine for severe ailments is unsafe and ineffective, which is why we need precision medicine that is ideal for a particular patient, based on individual anatomy.",india currently spends little 1 total gdp gross domestic product healthcare among lowest healthcare spends world according national health profile 2018 data isnt exclusive india healthcare budget around world tend grossly inadequatequality healthcare making right decision right time say gupta even u among highest proportion highly qualified medical specialist human error third leading cause death according 2016 john hopkins study technology play another major role making healthcare safer big data innovation machine learning many within medical community optimistic technology make healthcare safer cancer remains one biggest killer world number new case year projected reach 236 million 2030 according international agency research cancer light end tunnel say geetha manjunath founder niramai healthtech startup leveraging aidriven solution detects cancer abnormality breast cancer leading cause cancer death woman today one two woman breast cancer chance survival paradoxical given breast cancer completely curable say dr manjunath late detection delayed checkup biggest impediment battle cancer early detection achieved employing databased decisionmaking databased operation far scalable efficient that working towards say dr manjunath we confident specialty hospital turning datadriven solution cost cancer testing treatment reduce 16th present cost early diagnosis become reality say organization like niramai making rapid stride accuracy medical decisionmaking early symptom disease tend similar mean physician dispense generic medication patient generic medication meritsits cheap work well common infection indias dependency massproduced easily available antibiotic dangerous public immunity prescribing generic medicine severe ailment unsafe ineffective need precision medicine ideal particular patient based individual anatomy,1

Now, the Modi government has done a lot for Nirmal Ganga, like setting up new sewage treatment plants (STP) with newer technologies. But little has been done to ensure that the river draws its own source of fresh water. That has always been the difficult part and little progress has been made.

"Cloud is the weakest link: Cloud computing is an integral part of any enterprises operations. It allows stakeholders in the company to access their data from any location or device. To make this process less complicated, often the level of verification and security are not very stringent. This makes services running on the cloud more vulnerable to cyberattacks compared to on-premise services.


To break into cloud networks, hackers only need access to one of the employees email or computer account, which they acquire by sending a phoney mail (that might appear genuine) with a malicious link hoping the target will click on it. According to a 2018 report by Dome9., 18% of organizations were involved in cloud related security breaches in 2017.


Mobile and IoT are the Achilles heel: For ease of operations, most organizations have relaxed their bring your own device rules, allowing employees to routinely access work-related data through their personal smartphones. This proliferation of personal devices at workplaces has increased the risks for companies. According to Checkpoint, cybercriminals can spy on users and capture their login credentials while they log in to corporate systems containing sensitive data via their smartphones. Internet of Things (IoT) is another area that is growing very fast with little regard to security.

"Though it isnt yet widely available, the infrastructure is already on its way for mobile communications and the Internet of things. The spending to roll out DSRC tools might ultimately prove redundant. And its easy to overstate how quickly the latter can be introduced  it takes some time for laws to take effect, and the technology isnt widespread in cars now. By the time both happen, 5G could already be the prevalent technology.


Allowing multiple standards to develop in tandem would be a relief for Nokia Oyj and Ericsson AB, who are justifiably fearful that insisting on DSRC would delay the widespread rollout of 5G.


Its worth remembering that we are a long way from a time when autonomous cars roam the roads freely. So backing a particular standard would be foolish when the full requirements arent yet known. An agnostic approach to regulation is therefore absolutely sensible.


The advantage of rejecting the regulation is that it still leaves all options on the table. Could it make life harder for the likes of VW? Yes. a standard mandating DSRC would make it easier to stave off the competitive threat from the telecoms industry.",though isnt yet widely available infrastructure already way mobile communication internet thing spending roll dsrc tool might ultimately prove redundant its easy overstate quickly latter introduced  take time law take effect technology isnt widespread car time happen 5g could already prevalent technology allowing multiple standard develop tandem would relief nokia oyj ericsson ab justifiably fearful insisting dsrc would delay widespread rollout 5g its worth remembering long way time autonomous car roam road freely backing particular standard would foolish full requirement arent yet known agnostic approach regulation therefore absolutely sensible advantage rejecting regulation still leaf option table could make life harder like vw yes standard mandating dsrc would make easier stave competitive threat telecom industry,1

"A currency accord will likely require China to avoid devaluing to gain a competitive advantage, US trade representative Robert Lighthizer said last week, though he also said that there isnt yet a final agreement. That was a shift from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchins previous remarks that the US and China had concluded one of the strongest agreements ever on currency"".


Currency provisions have become an increasingly common feature of US trade deals in recent years. The Barack Obama administration insisted on including a commitment to not engage in competitive devaluations in the Trans-Pacific Partnership it negotiates with Japan and 10 other economies. The Donald Trump administration insisted on the inclusion of something similar in a renegotiated Nafta.


But by and large the provisions have been seen as symbolic and toothless. The Trump administration has also proven reluctant to act on the presidents rhetoric before. During his 2016 campaign Trump promised to officially label China a currency manipulator and take tough action.

"Majority of IoT devices currently rely on local network security, which means that everyone on the same network can gain access to them. If a security camera, for example, gets hacked and the attacker is able to get into the network, he/she can control most of the other IoT devices connected to the same network as the camera,"" warned Iliushin.


According to a report by Barracuda Labs, improvements have been made but new types of vulnerabilities have emerged like IoT credential compromise wherein, attackers exploit vulnerabilities in mobile and web applications to acquire credentials to access data saved on cloud. From an end user standpoint, unsecured IoT devices pose the highest risk to the privacy of a consumer. A vulnerable IoT device can give away your location, passwords, and data,"" cautions Sajan Paul, director systems engineering at Juniper Networks, India and SAARC. To avoid such attacks, consumers need to regularly update their devices, check default privacy and security settings, and change them as per their needs. Mikhail Kuzin, security researcher at Kaspersky Lab, believes that even if vendors begin to provide devices with better security now, it will be a while before old vulnerable devices are phased out of homes. Krishnapur recommends that users need to invest in more secure routers with in-built protection.

"Samsung, the worlds largest smartphone maker, said it provides a pre-installed Facebook app on selected models with options to disable it, and once its disabled, the app is no longer running. Facebook declined to provide a list of the partners with which it has deals for permanent apps, saying that those agreements vary by region and type. There is no complete list available online, and consumers may not know if Facebook is pre-loaded unless they specifically ask a customer service representative when they purchase a phone.


Consumer-advocacy groups have been sceptical of such arrangements for years, according to Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy.


Its only recently that people have become to understand that these apps really power the spy in your pocket,"" he said. Companies should be filing public documents on these deals, and Facebook should turn over public documents that show there is no data collection when the app is disabled.""


Facebook isnt the only company whose apps show up on smartphones by default. A T-Mobile US Inc. list of apps built into its version of the Samsung Galaxy S9, for example, includes the social network as well as Amazon.com Inc. The phone also comes loaded with many Google apps such as YouTube, Google Play Music and Gmail; Google is the creator of the Android software that powers the phone. Other phone makers and service providers, including LG Electronics Inc., Sony Corp., Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc., have made similar deals with app makers. When Twitters app is loaded on a new phone by default, it wouldnt collect any data unless a user had an account or created a new one, and opened the app and logged in, the company said.


But Facebook, which has spent the past year apologizing for security breaches and data privacy scandals, is the one drawing ire about its irrevocable presence on Samsungs phones. Very slimy,"" Twitter user Gopinath Pandalai in Bangalore, who goes by @gopibella, wrote on the site in October. Been a Samsung customer for 10 years.

"Music streaming may not be novel, but its still new. I think its making the world much smaller and making the creation of music much easier. Its giving the consumer the opportunity to engage with much more music in a very easy, effective, and efficient way. I think its bringing music to peoples pockets.


Would you call music streaming companies an evolution of distribution companies? If yes, how will it affect the industry in the long term?


I would say, yes. I believe in ubiquity for the artists. I think artists should be on all platforms, and platforms should not win based on exclusivity. Thats bad for the consumer. The platform should win based on their product and their relationship with the customer. The artist should not have to choose what service they should be on. Were not looking for exclusivity. We dont think its a good customer experience.


I think its in a nascent stage and needs evolution. I think youre experiencing the 2.0 version of streaming. One of my concerns is to make sure its not simply an echo chamber for somebodys tastes and they still have the ability to experience artists and songs that they didnt know they wanted.

"On the other hand, the hotel and airline loyalty programmes, which were a big driver of stickiness, are no longer a key criterion for customers. If they are getting a good deal on a platform, their loyalties shift. Old tour operators and travel agents are becoming irrelevant.


The future of the travel and hospitality sector will also be an era of alliances, where todays disruptors get disrupted, making way for a new and sustainable ecosystem.


The current complex travel ecosystem will consolidate and equalize power of demand and supply. Technology will redefine the role of ecosystem players in the value chain and visionary companies will try to gain direct access to either customers or inventory. There is potential for the direct foray of technology giants and social media players into the travel ecosystem as they have access to customers which may disrupt the online travel aggregators. Alliances are expected to eventually pave way for a viable ecosystem. The boundaries are blurring and partnerships are emerging.


For example, Marriott has partnered with Alibabas OTA Fliggy to access Chinese tourists, while Amazon has partnered with Kayak for voice-based bookings through Alexa. Collaborations such as Airbnbs latest investment in Oyo Rooms will also change the way the industry grows.


Technology players like Google are making the local intermediary roles relevant again with its Google Trips, a personalized tour guide app connecting local tour operators to travellers. Travellers are bound to gain the maximum value for the money spent and will be spoilt for choice as they will be at the heart of innovation. Today, smartphones are acting as personal digital assistants and in the future, they will emerge as personal digital advisors.

"The Narendra Modi government simply finished the job of electrification started by previous governments, but quality of access still remains an issue. (Pradeep Gaur/Mint)


In the five years of Narendra Modi government, India witnessed near-universal electrification, but the quality of power access remains an issue, a Mint analysis shows


Mumbai/New Delhi: In its 2014 election campaign, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) promised to bring development, and specifically electricity, to all of Indias villages and homes. However, by then, almost all of Indias villages (97%) already had an electricity connection, according to data from the Central Electricity Authority (CEA). This left the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance-II (NDA-II) to simply finish the job.


It did this, amid much fanfare, in April 2018 when Leisang in Manipur became Indias last village to be electrified. The NDA-II has electrified 20,910 villages, some in Indias most remote locations, but the bulk of the work had been done by previous regimesthe United Progressive Alliance-II (UPA-II) electrified 80,189 villages and UPA-I 52,611 villages.


Village electrification, however, is only the first step in delivering power across India. A village is declared electrified if just 10% of the households has electricity connections, which masks poor access at household-level. The bigger challenge facing the Narendra Modi government was to provide households with higher quality and regular supply of electricity. And even here, data suggests that the NDA-II were simply building on groundwork done by previous governments.",narendra modi government simply finished job electrification started previous government quality access still remains issue pradeep gaurmint five year narendra modi government india witnessed nearuniversal electrification quality power access remains issue mint analysis show mumbainew delhi 2014 election campaign bharatiya janata party bjp promised bring development specifically electricity indias village home however almost indias village 97 already electricity connection according data central electricity authority cea left bjpled national democratic allianceii ndaii simply finish job amid much fanfare april 2018 leisang manipur became indias last village electrified ndaii electrified 20910 village indias remote location bulk work done previous regimesthe united progressive allianceii upaii electrified 80189 village upai 52611 village village electrification however first step delivering power across india village declared electrified 10 household electricity connection mask poor access householdlevel bigger challenge facing narendra modi government provide household higher quality regular supply electricity even data suggests ndaii simply building groundwork done previous government,0

"Section 126 of the Representation of People Act prohibits advertising and campaigning on TV and other electronic media during the silent period, which is 48 hours before the end of polling.


Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora referred to the model code of conduct and urged social media representatives to come up with a code similar to it. He said the code would be used for the ongoing election process in the ""immediate context"" and would be a lasting document in the long run.

"With these techniques, machines are also learning to read and write. For years, experts questioned whether neural networks could crack the code of natural language. But the tide has shifted in recent months.


Organizations such as Google and OpenAI, an independent lab in San Francisco, have built systems that learn the vagaries of language at the broadest scales  analysing everything from Wikipedia articles to self-published romance novels  before applying the knowledge to specific tasks. The systems can read a paragraph and answer questions about it. They can judge whether a movie review is positive or negative.


This technology could improve phishing bots such as SNAP_R. Today, most Twitter bots seem like bots, especially when you start replying to them. In the future, they will respond in kind.


The technology also could lead to the creation of voice bots that can carry on a decent conversation  and, no doubt one day, will call and persuade you to divulge your credit-card information.


These new language systems are driven by a new wave of computing power. Google engineers have designed computer chips specifically for training neural networks. Other companies are building similar chips, and as these arrive, they will accelerate AI research even further.


Jack Clark, head of policy at OpenAI, can see a not-too-distant future in which governments create machine-learning systems that attempt to radicalize populations in other countries, or force views onto their own people.


This is a new kind of societal control or propaganda,"" he said. Governments can start to create campaigns that target individuals, but at the same time operate across many people in parallel, with a larger objective.""


Ideally, artificial intelligence could also provide ways of identifying and stopping this kind of mass manipulation. Mark Zuckerberg likes to talk about the possibilities. But for the foreseeable future, we face a machine-learning arms race.",technique machine also learning read write year expert questioned whether neural network could crack code natural language tide shifted recent month organization google openai independent lab san francisco built system learn vagary language broadest scale  analysing everything wikipedia article selfpublished romance novel  applying knowledge specific task system read paragraph answer question judge whether movie review positive negative technology could improve phishing bot snapr today twitter bot seem like bot especially start replying future respond kind technology also could lead creation voice bot carry decent conversation  doubt one day call persuade divulge creditcard information new language system driven new wave computing power google engineer designed computer chip specifically training neural network company building similar chip arrive accelerate ai research even jack clark head policy openai see nottoodistant future government create machinelearning system attempt radicalize population country force view onto people this new kind societal control propaganda said governments start create campaign target individual time operate across many people parallel larger objective ideally artificial intelligence could also provide way identifying stopping kind mass manipulation mark zuckerberg like talk possibility foreseeable future face machinelearning arm race,1

"UDAY mandated that discoms bring the gap between average revenue and average costs to zero. Here, too, there has been progress with the gap reducing (from ?0.60/kWh in 2015-16 to ?0.17/kWh in 2017-18), but 21 of 26 states are still unlikely to meet the target.


According to a National Institute of Public Finance and Policy study, this data suggests that the UDAY scheme is failing to turn around the power sector. The authors also find that discoms remain plagued by operational inefficiencies such as lack of effective billing procedures, poor measurement of power consumption, and ineffective monitoring of power theft.


Taken together, data shows that the NDA has built on the previous governments work to get more households electrifiedbut quality of access still remains an issue.


While the government has tried to address this by improving the financial health of discoms, much more needs to be done. The inability of successive governments to revive discom fortunes could have important ramifications for Indias development.
